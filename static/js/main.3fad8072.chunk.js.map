the average marks scored in mathematics is 60%. One student scored 70%. Has this particular student fared better at mathematics than class average? The answer is a simple yes. The 10% gap in simple terms is alpha.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Alpha is a tool to calculate investment progress in comparison to a benchmark like an index. A positive alpha of 1.0 translates into the fund’s outperformance over its benchmark index by 1%. A negative alpha of 1.0 indicates underperformance of 1%.&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nAlpha= R – Rf – beta (Rm-Rf)<br />\\r\\nAlpha as per the above formula can explained as Portfolio Return minus the Risk free rate of return minus Beta (measure of volatility of returns in a portfolio) multiplied by Benchmark return minus Risk free rate of return. For example, assuming that the actual return of the fund is 30, the risk-free rate is 8%, beta is 1.1, and the benchmark index return is 20%, alpha is calculated as:<br />\\r\\nAlpha = (0.30-0.08) – 1.1 (0.20-0.08) = 0. 088 or 8.8%<br />\\r\\nThe above reflects the investment’s outperformance over its benchmark index by 8.8%.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hgroup>\\r\\n\\t<h4><strong>AMC</strong></h4>\\r\\n</hgroup>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>AMC - 'Asset Management Company’. As the name suggest it is a company that is responsible for managing the assets purchased using one’s investment funds.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>AMC is a company that decides to invest funds pooled by clients into different types of securities as per stated objectives, thereby providing clients more diversification and investment options. AMCs earn income by charging service fees to clients.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hgroup>\\r\\n\\t<h4><strong>AUM</strong></h4>\\r\\n</hgroup>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>AUM – ‘Assets Under Management’<br />\\r\\nAUM is the total market value of investments managed by AMCs.&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nWhy is it relevant? AMC’s charge fund management fees on the assets managed by them. Thus higher the AUM implies higher is the fees earned by the AMC.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hgroup>\\r\\n\\t<h4><strong>Beta</strong></h4>\\r\\n</hgroup>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We all would clearly enjoy higher returns or alpha. However there is no free lunch. Higher returns may also be accompanied with higher risk. Just like alpha measures the return of one’s funds compared to an index, Beta measures the volatility of returns or risk in a portfolio compared to the entire market. Stock with a higher beta has greater risk. It is translated as below:&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nIf Beta is 1, then the risk of portfolio is exactly as per the market. So, if Sensex or Nifty go up by 5%, the portfolio value would go up by 5%. If Sensex or Nifty fall by 2%, the portfolio value is expected to fall by 2%.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If Beta is higher than 1, then the portfolio is more volatile than the market. Example if Beta is 2, if Sensex or Nifty go up by 5%, the portfolio value would go up by 10%, if Sensex or Nifty fall by 2%, the portfolio value is expected to fall by 4%.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If Beta is lesser than 1, then the portfolio is less volatile than the market. Example if Beta is 0.5, if Sensex or Nifty go up by 5%, the portfolio value would go up by 2.5%, if Sensex or Nifty fall by 2%, the portfolio value is expected to fall by 1%.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If Beta is zero, then the portfolio is uncorrelated to the market<br />\\r\\nIf Beta is less than zero, then the portfolio is negatively uncorrelated to the market</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hgroup>\\r\\n\\t<h4><strong>Benchmark</strong></h4>\\r\\n</hgroup>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Student A has scored 95% in mathematics. How does that compare to another student B who has scored 90% in a literature subject. Difficult to compare right? But if the remaining students have all scored 100% in mathematics then one knows that the student A has not fared well in mathematics. A benchmark is a standard used against which mutual fund performance is measured.&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nHence a Pharma fund’s performance would need to be compared to a benchmark made of pharma companies e.g. Nifty Pharma index.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hgroup>\\r\\n\\t<h4><strong>Capital Gain</strong></h4>\\r\\n</hgroup>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One has being investing Rs 10,000/- in a balanced&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/investment\\\" title=\\\"Mutual Fund\\\">mutual funds</a>&nbsp;every month to save for a car. After 4 years one has invested Rs 4,80,000/-. Due to a strong equity market the fund has given good returns and the value of total investment is Rs 6,00,000/- today. One decides it is time to buy a car finally and liquidate one’s investments. The difference between current fund value (Rs 6,00,000/-) and the amount invested (Rs 4,80,000/-) is capital gains earned.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is the profit earned from disposing of an asset, or from holding it while its market value increases. It essentially is increase in value of an asset (such as stock or real estate) between the time it is bought and the time it is sold.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are 2 kinds of capital gains, 1) Short Term Capital Gain and 2) Long Term Capital Gain. They are determined by type of fund and the tenor of holding.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Short Term Capital Gain:\\r\\n\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>For equity funds if the holding period is less than 1 year.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>For Debt funds if the holding period is less than 3 year.</li>\\r\\n\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Long Term Capital Gain:\\r\\n\\t<ul>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>For equity funds if the holding period is more than 1 year.</li>\\r\\n\\t\\t<li>For Debt funds if the holding period is more than 3 year.</li>\\r\\n\\t</ul>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Closed ended funds</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Closed-ended funds are a type of funds that are not redeemable from the fund. Unlike open-end funds, which one can redeem at any given point, investors in closed ended funds commit their funds for the duration of the fund.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the time of New Fund offering, the AMC issues a specific number of shares based on the amount of money raised. No additions can be made thereafter.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The advantage of a closed ended fund is that the fund manager need not worry about redemptions in the fund and hence can invest for the entire duration of the fund in securities that may provide higher returns but also carry higher risk in short term.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Compounding</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Let us assume there are two investors, A &amp; B. They start working at the age of 20. Investor A starts investing Rs. 1000/- per month right from the start of his career for the next 10 years. That’s a total investment of Rs. 1,20,000/-. He leaves the investment in the market for next 30 years, until he is 60 years old. Investor B starts investing after initial 10 years of his career. But to build a nest he starts investing Rs.1000/- per month for the next 30 years. That’s a total investment of Rs. 3,60,000/-.&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nAssuming a market return of 8% p.a., who would have a larger retirement fund at the age of 60?<br />\\r\\nInvestor A has contributed a lot less than Investor B, but due to the power of compounding, Investor A has a retirement nest of Rs. 20,13,000/- whereas Investor B has managed to accumulate a wealth of Rs. 15,00,000/-.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This is the power of compounding and starting early towards long term goals even with relatively smaller amounts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>No doubt Albert Einstein called compound interest the eighth wonder of the world.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Consolidated Account Statement</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Consolidated Account Statement is akin to a bank account statement. Only difference is that a Consolidated Account Statement gives an investor all the details regarding sales, purchases and other transactions in a mutual fund in an orderly manner in a single place whereas a bank account statement would give details of banking transactions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This is the power of compounding and starting early towards long term goals even with relatively smaller amounts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>No doubt Albert Einstein called compound interest the eighth wonder of the world.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Typical details included are:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Investor name and contact details</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>All financial purchases and transactions like switching, redemption or merging of funds,</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Dividend or bonus payments, reinvestment details</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Way of investing – lumpsum or a Systematic Investment Plan</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Closing and opening share unit portfolio balance.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An account statement also gives a proper insight to the investors about how to track mutual fund performance.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>ELSS</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>ELSS schemes are diversified equity schemes, primarily subscribed to, as they offer tax benefits under the Section 80C of Income Tax Act 1961. Returns from an ELSS scheme are tax free. One can claim upto Rs. 1 lakh of one’s ELSS investment as a deduction from one’s gross total income in a financial year.&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nHowever they also carry a lock-in period of 3 years.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Entry Load</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Mutual fund companies collect a fee from all investors when they enter or exit scheme. This fee is called load. In simple terms, investors would purchase a mutual fund at the net asset value (NAV) plus the entry load. This would increase the purchase price per unit for the investor thereby reducing the amount of units allotted to the investor.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Exit Load</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Mutual funds collect a specific amount from all the investors when they enter or exit a scheme. This fee charged is called load.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Frequent withdrawals will force a mutual fund to keep aside more and more funds in cash and thereby impact the overall returns of the funds. The objective of collecting it when investors exit the scheme, is to dissuade them from exiting, thereby reducing the number of investors withdrawing. Various mutual funds houses charge different fees as loads.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Expense Ratio</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Expense ratio is basically the total expense amount charged to the fund divided by the total Asset Under Management. It is expressed in percentage terms.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So how does an expense ratio impact investor returns? Higher expense ratio implies lower return for the investor as the expense ratio is deducted from the return generated by the funds from the market.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>KYC</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Complying with the Know Your Customer or KYC norms is mandatory for every mutual fund's investor. It is important for an investor to submit their identity details to the mutual fund houses.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>KYC is one time exercise while dealing in securities markets - once KYC is done through a SEBI registered intermediary (broker, DP, Mutual Fund, etc), one need not undergo the same process again when you approach another intermediary.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An investor needs to submit identity documents along with the KYC form. Typically, the identity document includes ID Proof, Address Proof along with passport size photograph.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Load</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Load is a sales charge or commission paid to the mutual fund. The investor pays the load, for compensation to sales intermediary for his time and expertise in selecting an appropriate fund for the investor.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>NAV</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>NAV is the market value of the securities held by the scheme including cash, less liabilities divided by the total number of units of the scheme on any particular date. As market value of stocks changes every day, NAV of a scheme also changes daily.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For example, if the market value of all securities of a mutual fund scheme is Rs. 20,00,000 and the mutual fund has issued 1,00,000 units of INR 10 each to the investors, then the NAV per unit of the fund is Rs 20.00<br />\\r\\nNAV of all open ended funds is required to be disclosed by the mutual fund on a daily basis.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Open Ended Funds</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Open-End Fund is the type of mutual fund, that does not restrict the number of units issued by the fund. Investors can issue and redeem units continuously, since there is no limit on the issuance of number of open-end fund units.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Open Ended Funds</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Open-End Fund is the type of mutual fund, that does not restrict the number of units issued by the fund. Investors can issue and redeem units continuously, since there is no limit on the issuance of number of open-end fund units.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>SIP</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/investment\\\" title=\\\"Systematic Investment Plan\\\">Systematic Investment Plan</a>&nbsp;is an investment strategy wherein an investor needs to invest a pre-determined amount of money in a particular mutual fund at every stipulated time period (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The investor is allocated certain number of units based on the ongoing market rate (called NAV or net asset value) for the day. Every time one invests money, additional units of the scheme are purchased at the market rate and added to one’s account.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Further investors need not worry about investing at the wrong time. For a regular investor, the same amount of money fetches more units when the prices are low and less units when the price is high. This may help an investor achieve lower weighted average cost per unit.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Standard Deviation</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Standard Deviation (SD) is a statistical measure that captures the difference between the average of a data set and how far the individual points are spread out from the average number. A low standard deviation indicates that numbers are close to average. A high standard deviation indicates that numbers are spread out.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the finance world, Standard Deviation is used to determine volatility of returns. Higher standard deviation implies higher volatility of returns which in turn implies higher the risk of the portfolio. Accordingly lower standard deviation implies lower risk.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Units</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Mutual funds issue units to the investors as per funds invested by them. Investors of mutual funds are known as unitholders. Transaction of mutual funds is done in units. For example, consider that one is investing Rs 500 per month through a SIP in a mutual fund. If the NAV of the mutual fund is 25 on the day of the purchase, then 20 units would be bought for Rs 500.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Dividend</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As a unit holder in a scheme one is expecting some return on one’s investment. So when the scheme is doing well, one would expect to gain from one’s investments. In case the mutual fund company decides to share the growth in NAV with its unit holders regularly, they can do so by declaring dividend. In simple terms it implies sharing some of the gains with the unit holders during the course of their holding rather than accumulating the gains until the unit holder can redeem the units.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Some important points to remember regarding dividends:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>The amount and frequency of dividends is not guaranteed.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Dividends are declared only when the scheme makes a profit and it is at the discretion of the asset management company.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Dividend is paid from the units of NAV. Thus the NAV of the fund will drop atleast to the extent of the dividend declared.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>NFO</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A new fund offer (NFO) is a subscription offer for the first time for a new scheme launched by the asset management companies (AMCs). A new fund offer is launched to raise public capital to buy stocks and bonds from the market.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Flexi-SIP</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A Flexi SIP allows an investor to vary the amount of one’s investments every month. If the investor does not want a fixed amount but wants more control over ones investments, the investor can set up a Flexi SIP.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>With Flexi-SIP, an investor needs to&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/10-reasons-to-invest-in-a-mutual-fund.html\\\" title=\\\"Choose a Mutual Fund Scheme\\\">choose a mutual fund scheme</a>, a minimum investment amount, and an investment date like for any other SIP. However, investors can choose maximum investment amount.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>After this, every month, the investor will have the flexibility to set the amount for the next SIP instalment. This can be any amount between the minimum required for that scheme and the maximum set by the investor.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>ULIP</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Unit Linked Insurance Plan is a financial product that combines investment as well as insurance. In an ULIP the premium amount, after deduction of charges, is invested into funds of one’s choice. Funds could be equity or debt based.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Fund performance depends on the market. ULIPs are similar to mutual funds, except that ULIPs are like investment products with insurance benefits.</p>\\r\\n\",\r\n                \"format\": \"full_html\",\r\n                \"processed\": \"<p>In the popular Bollywood movie, 3 Idiots, in a humorous scene, a book was sarcastically defined as instruments that record, analyse, summarise, organise, debate and explain information; that are illustrated, non-illustrated, hardbound, paperback, jacketed, non-jacketed; with foreword, introduction, table of contents, index; that are indented for the enlightenment, understanding, enrichment, enhancement and education of the human brain through sensory route of vision - sometimes touch.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Below is a list of terms that we have chosen:</strong></h4>\\n\\n<ul id=\\\"articlenav\\\">\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#alpha\\\">Alpha</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#amc\\\">AMC</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#aum\\\">AUM</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#beta\\\">Beta</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#benchmark\\\">Benchmark</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#capital_gain\\\">Capital Gain</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#closed_ended_funds\\\">Closed ended funds</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#compounding\\\">Compounding</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#consolidated_account_statement\\\">Consolidated Account Statement</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#elss\\\">ELSS</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#entry_load\\\">Entry Load</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#exit_load\\\">Exit Load</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#expense_ratio\\\">Expense Ratio</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#kyc\\\">KYC</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#load\\\">Load</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#nav\\\">NAV</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#open_ended_funds\\\">Open Ended Funds</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#sip\\\">SIP</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#standard_deviation\\\">Standard Deviation</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#units\\\">Units</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#dividend\\\">Dividend</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#nfo\\\">NFO</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#flexi_sip\\\">Flexi-SIP</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/dejargonifying-mutual-fund-terms.html#ulip\\\">ULIP</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Alpha</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>In a class of 30 students, the average marks scored in mathematics is 60%.

After 4 years one has invested Rs 4,80,000/-. Due to a strong equity market the fund has given good returns and the value of total investment is Rs 6,00,000/- today. One decides it is time to buy a car finally and liquidate one’s investments. The difference between current fund value (Rs 6,00,000/-) and the amount invested (Rs 4,80,000/-) is capital gains earned.</p>\\n\\n<p>It is the profit earned from disposing of an asset, or from holding it while its market value increases. It essentially is increase in value of an asset (such as stock or real estate) between the time it is bought and the time it is sold.</p>\\n\\n<p>There are 2 kinds of capital gains, 1) Short Term Capital Gain and 2) Long Term Capital Gain. They are determined by type of fund and the tenor of holding.</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n\\t<li>Short Term Capital Gain:\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t<li>For equity funds if the holding period is less than 1 year.</li>\\n\\t\\t<li>For Debt funds if the holding period is less than 3 year.</li>\\n\\t</ul>\\n\\t</li>\\n\\t<li>Long Term Capital Gain:\\n\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t<li>For equity funds if the holding period is more than 1 year.</li>\\n\\t\\t<li>For Debt funds if the holding period is more than 3 year.</li>\\n\\t</ul>\\n\\t</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Closed ended funds</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>Closed-ended funds are a type of funds that are not redeemable from the fund. Unlike open-end funds, which one can redeem at any given point, investors in closed ended funds commit their funds for the duration of the fund.</p>\\n\\n<p>At the time of New Fund offering, the AMC issues a specific number of shares based on the amount of money raised. No additions can be made thereafter.</p>\\n\\n<p>The advantage of a closed ended fund is that the fund manager need not worry about redemptions in the fund and hence can invest for the entire duration of the fund in securities that may provide higher returns but also carry higher risk in short term.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Compounding</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>Let us assume there are two investors, A &amp; B. They start working at the age of 20. Investor A starts investing Rs. 1000/- per month right from the start of his career for the next 10 years. That’s a total investment of Rs. 1,20,000/-. He leaves the investment in the market for next 30 years, until he is 60 years old. Investor B starts investing after initial 10 years of his career. But to build a nest he starts investing Rs.1000/- per month for the next 30 years. That’s a total investment of Rs. 3,60,000/-. <br />\\nAssuming a market return of 8% p.a., who would have a larger retirement fund at the age of 60?<br />\\nInvestor A has contributed a lot less than Investor B, but due to the power of compounding, Investor A has a retirement nest of Rs. 20,13,000/- whereas Investor B has managed to accumulate a wealth of Rs. 15,00,000/-.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is the power of compounding and starting early towards long term goals even with relatively smaller amounts.</p>\\n\\n<p>No doubt Albert Einstein called compound interest the eighth wonder of the world.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Consolidated Account Statement</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>Consolidated Account Statement is akin to a bank account statement. Only difference is that a Consolidated Account Statement gives an investor all the details regarding sales, purchases and other transactions in a mutual fund in an orderly manner in a single place whereas a bank account statement would give details of banking transactions.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is the power of compounding and starting early towards long term goals even with relatively smaller amounts.</p>\\n\\n<p>No doubt Albert Einstein called compound interest the eighth wonder of the world.</p>\\n\\n<p>Typical details included are:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Investor name and contact details</li>\\n\\t<li>All financial purchases and transactions like switching, redemption or merging of funds,</li>\\n\\t<li>Dividend or bonus payments, reinvestment details</li>\\n\\t<li>Way of investing – lumpsum or a Systematic Investment Plan</li>\\n\\t<li>Closing and opening share unit portfolio balance.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n<p>An account statement also gives a proper insight to the investors about how to track mutual fund performance.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>ELSS</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>ELSS schemes are diversified equity schemes, primarily subscribed to, as they offer tax benefits under the Section 80C of Income Tax Act 1961. Returns from an ELSS scheme are tax free. One can claim upto Rs. 1 lakh of one’s ELSS investment as a deduction from one’s gross total income in a financial year. <br />\\nHowever they also carry a lock-in period of 3 years.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Entry Load</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>Mutual fund companies collect a fee from all investors when they enter or exit scheme. This fee is called load. In simple terms, investors would purchase a mutual fund at the net asset value (NAV) plus the entry load. This would increase the purchase price per unit for the investor thereby reducing the amount of units allotted to the investor.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Exit Load</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>Mutual funds collect a specific amount from all the investors when they enter or exit a scheme. This fee charged is called load.</p>\\n\\n<p>Frequent withdrawals will force a mutual fund to keep aside more and more funds in cash and thereby impact the overall returns of the funds. The objective of collecting it when investors exit the scheme, is to dissuade them from exiting, thereby reducing the number of investors withdrawing. Various mutual funds houses charge different fees as loads.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Expense Ratio</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>Expense ratio is basically the total expense amount charged to the fund divided by the total Asset Under Management. It is expressed in percentage terms.</p>\\n\\n<p>So how does an expense ratio impact investor returns? Higher expense ratio implies lower return for the investor as the expense ratio is deducted from the return generated by the funds from the market.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>KYC</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>Complying with the Know Your Customer or KYC norms is mandatory for every mutual fund's investor. It is important for an investor to submit their identity details to the mutual fund houses.</p>\\n\\n<p>KYC is one time exercise while dealing in securities markets - once KYC is done through a SEBI registered intermediary (broker, DP, Mutual Fund, etc), one need not undergo the same process again when you approach another intermediary.</p>\\n\\n<p>An investor needs to submit identity documents along with the KYC form. Typically, the identity document includes ID Proof, Address Proof along with passport size photograph.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Load</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>Load is a sales charge or commission paid to the mutual fund. The investor pays the load, for compensation to sales intermediary for his time and expertise in selecting an appropriate fund for the investor.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>NAV</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>NAV is the market value of the securities held by the scheme including cash, less liabilities divided by the total number of units of the scheme on any particular date. As market value of stocks changes every day, NAV of a scheme also changes daily.</p>\\n\\n<p>For example, if the market value of all securities of a mutual fund scheme is Rs. 20,00,000 and the mutual fund has issued 1,00,000 units of INR 10 each to the investors, then the NAV per unit of the fund is Rs 20.00<br />\\nNAV of all open ended funds is required to be disclosed by the mutual fund on a daily basis.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Open Ended Funds</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>Open-End Fund is the type of mutual fund, that does not restrict the number of units issued by the fund. Investors can issue and redeem units continuously, since there is no limit on the issuance of number of open-end fund units.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Open Ended Funds</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>Open-End Fund is the type of mutual fund, that does not restrict the number of units issued by the fund. Investors can issue and redeem units continuously, since there is no limit on the issuance of number of open-end fund units.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>SIP</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/investment\\\" title=\\\"Systematic Investment Plan\\\">Systematic Investment Plan</a> is an investment strategy wherein an investor needs to invest a pre-determined amount of money in a particular mutual fund at every stipulated time period (weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.).</p>\\n\\n<p>The investor is allocated certain number of units based on the ongoing market rate (called NAV or net asset value) for the day. Every time one invests money, additional units of the scheme are purchased at the market rate and added to one’s account.</p>\\n\\n<p>Further investors need not worry about investing at the wrong time. For a regular investor, the same amount of money fetches more units when the prices are low and less units when the price is high. This may help an investor achieve lower weighted average cost per unit.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Standard Deviation</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>Standard Deviation (SD) is a statistical measure that captures the difference between the average of a data set and how far the individual points are spread out from the average number. A low standard deviation indicates that numbers are close to average. A high standard deviation indicates that numbers are spread out.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the finance world, Standard Deviation is used to determine volatility of returns. Higher standard deviation implies higher volatility of returns which in turn implies higher the risk of the portfolio. Accordingly lower standard deviation implies lower risk.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Units</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>Mutual funds issue units to the investors as per funds invested by them. Investors of mutual funds are known as unitholders. Transaction of mutual funds is done in units. For example, consider that one is investing Rs 500 per month through a SIP in a mutual fund. If the NAV of the mutual fund is 25 on the day of the purchase, then 20 units would be bought for Rs 500.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Dividend</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>As a unit holder in a scheme one is expecting some return on one’s investment. So when the scheme is doing well, one would expect to gain from one’s investments. In case the mutual fund company decides to share the growth in NAV with its unit holders regularly, they can do so by declaring dividend. In simple terms it implies sharing some of the gains with the unit holders during the course of their holding rather than accumulating the gains until the unit holder can redeem the units.</p>\\n\\n<p>Some important points to remember regarding dividends:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>The amount and frequency of dividends is not guaranteed.</li>\\n\\t<li>Dividends are declared only when the scheme makes a profit and it is at the discretion of the asset management company.</li>\\n\\t<li>Dividend is paid from the units of NAV. Thus the NAV of the fund will drop atleast to the extent of the dividend declared.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>NFO</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>A new fund offer (NFO) is a subscription offer for the first time for a new scheme launched by the asset management companies (AMCs). A new fund offer is launched to raise public capital to buy stocks and bonds from the market.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Flexi-SIP</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>A Flexi SIP allows an investor to vary the amount of one’s investments every month. If the investor does not want a fixed amount but wants more control over ones investments, the investor can set up a Flexi SIP.</p>\\n\\n<p>With Flexi-SIP, an investor needs to <a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/10-reasons-to-invest-in-a-mutual-fund.html\\\" title=\\\"Choose a Mutual Fund Scheme\\\">choose a mutual fund scheme</a>, a minimum investment amount, and an investment date like for any other SIP. However, investors can choose maximum investment amount.</p>\\n\\n<p>After this, every month, the investor will have the flexibility to set the amount for the next SIP instalment. This can be any amount between the minimum required for that scheme and the maximum set by the investor.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>ULIP</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>Unit Linked Insurance Plan is a financial product that combines investment as well as insurance. In an ULIP the premium amount, after deduction of charges, is invested into funds of one’s choice. Funds could be equity or debt based.</p>\\n\\n<p>Fund performance depends on the market. ULIPs are similar to mutual funds, except that ULIPs are like investment products with insurance benefits.</p>\\n\",\r\n                \"summary\": \"\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"comment\": {\r\n                \"status\": 2,\r\n                \"cid\": 1,\r\n                \"last_comment_timestamp\": 1557391806,\r\n                \"last_comment_name\": \"\",\r\n                \"last_comment_uid\": 1,\r\n                \"comment_count\": 1\r\n            },\r\n            \"field_description\": \"Defining a simple word can be extremely confusing.

They offer diversification of assets as per individual’s objective, professional management and liquidity, at the same time allowing investors to avail benefits from the lower trading cost. A mutual fund is professionally managed and always keep aside some part of the money as cash to fulfil redemptions. Every investor gets to participate by holding units or shares that are proportional to the amount invested. The gains recorded by a mutual fund are distributed correspondingly among investors after deducting certain expenses.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hgroup>\\r\\n\\t<h4><strong>Why should one invest in Mutual Funds?</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t<h5>To enjoy better returns</h5>\\r\\n</hgroup>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>The best performing&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/investment\\\" title=\\\"Mutual Fund\\\">mutual funds</a>&nbsp;have offered returns of anywhere between 15% to 20% consistently over the last 2 decades. An individual who would have invested Rs 10,000 every month would be able to create a corpus of Rs 27,86,573 assuming a CAGR of 15% But if we extrapolate this case to 20 years, the individual ends up with a corpus of almost Rs 1.5 crores.</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Very few asset classes are able to match up to such returns. And what is the icing on the cake?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Liquidity!</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>You can redeem your mutual fund units anytime you wish. The redemption time varies between 1-2 working days for debt-oriented funds and 4-5 days for equity-oriented funds.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Accurate selling price</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>During the redemption, mutual fund units will be sold according to the NAV as on that day. Which means you get exactly what your investment is worth.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Inflation beating returns</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What costs Rs 2 lakhs today, would cost Rs 4 lakhs after nine years considering an inflation rate of 8%. Most asset classes are not able to beat inflation effectively. Mutual Funds offer inflation beating returns consistently over a period of time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Goal based investing</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>People have several goals in life. They wish to buy latest gadgets, travel to exotic destinations, purchase an automobile with all the bells and whistles, buy a house, educate their children in the best universities and hopefully – retire early!&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nThese goals can be primarily divided into short term, medium term and long term.&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nChoosing the right type of fund is critical to ensure that your financial goals are achieved.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Short Term Goal</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One can invest in debt-oriented funds to prepare for achieving short term goals. These funds are less volatile and offer steady returns as they primarily are invested in government securities, bonds and other debt instruments. If one’s investment horizon is less than 2 years, debt oriented mutual funds are recommended.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Medium Term Goal</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Medium term goals may require an investment duration of 3 to 6 years. Balanced funds, which invest in a comfortable mix of equity and debt instruments, are most suitable to help an investor achieve medium term goals.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Long Term Goal</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Long term goals may require an investment duration of more than 7 years. One can consider equity-oriented funds as these invest heavily in equities. The time frame is also such that the fund can take advantage of market volatility to offer attractive returns.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hgroup>\\r\\n\\t<h4><strong>Different types of Mutual Funds</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t<h5>How does one decide which type of mutual fund to invest in?</h5>\\r\\n</hgroup>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One can choose a mutual fund scheme based on one’s investment duration, objective and risk appetite.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Based on maturity or investment duration!</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Depending on its maturity period, a mutual fund scheme can be classified into open-ended scheme or close-ended scheme.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Open-ended Fund/ Scheme</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As the name suggest, an open-ended fund or scheme is one that is available for subscription and sale on a continuous basis. These schemes do not have a fixed maturity period. Investors can conveniently buy and sell units at Net Asset Value (NAV) which are declared on a daily basis. The key feature of open-end schemes is liquidity.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Close-ended Fund/ Scheme</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A close-ended fund or scheme has a maturity period that is clearly specified. When the scheme is launched, the fund is open for subscription only during a prescribed period. Thereafter investors can buy or sell the units of the scheme on the stock exchanges as they would do in case of any other listed security. To enable investors to exit, some close-ended funds offer an option of selling back the units to the mutual fund through periodic repurchase at NAV related prices.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Based on objective &gt; Receiving Creating a corpus or Regular Income – Growth or Dividend</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One’s investment objective may also determine the type of fund which one would have to shortlist:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Growth Funds</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Growth funds usually put a huge portion in shares and growth sectors, suitable for investors who have a surplus of idle money to be distributed in riskier plans (albeit with possibly high returns) and can wait over a period of time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This will also require the investment horizon to be longer as volatile markets may cause adverse movement in value of these funds and hence there may not be immediate or steady returns.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Dividend Funds</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For investors who seek to earn a regular income, dividend funds are best suited. However, there is a difference in the dividends that are offered by stocks and by mutual funds. In the case of stocks, dividends are earnings generated by a company (usually profits) that are distributed amongst shareholders. This is besides the appreciation in share price of a stock. Whereas in the case of a dividend mutual fund, a small chunk of the units or shares of the mutual fund are sold at a price which is higher than the purchase price to earn dividends. The dividend pay-outs can be monthly, quarterly or yearly. Depending on the fund, the dividend can also be re-invested.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Based on Risk Appetite</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Risk appetite is also a function of investment goals. A retired citizen who is investing for regular monthly income would have a different risk appetite from someone who is investing with horizon of a decade for buying a house.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Index funds mirror an index.</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These funds will purchase stocks in the same proportion in which they comprise an index. For instance, if a particular stock forms 2% of an index which is being followed by a mutual fund, the mutual fund will invest 2% of its investible corpus in that particular stock. The performance of an index fund will more or less mimic that of the index which it follows except for a difference that would creep up, known as tracking error. Expenses incurred by an index fund are lower as compared to other types of mutual funds.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Balanced funds are also known as hybrid funds. These are primarily of two types: Equity Oriented Funds and Debt Oriented Funds.</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Equity-oriented funds</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Equity-oriented funds invest a mix of equity (at least 65 per cent of the corpus) and debt. These funds offer attractive returns over a longer period of time but returns can be highly volatile in the short term. These funds are suitable for investors who can deal with the risk and have a longer investment horizon.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Debt-oriented funds</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>are low risk funds that primarily invest in highly rated corporate bonds and stable government bonds. They offer steady returns and are suitable for conservative investors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Equity Linked Savings Schemes</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Equity Linked Savings Schemes make it possible for investors to claim upto Rs 1.5 lakhs as tax deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act while creating a corpus! However, an investor cannot withdraw money before 3 years as this scheme has a mandatory lock in period.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Largecap Funds</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Largecap funds invest mostly in big companies. Funds identify these companies by their market capitalisation. These companies are well established and have immense credibility. They are most likely to be among the top names in their respective sector. Although there is no fixed nomenclature, a company whose market cap is more than Rs 10,000 crores is considered to be a large cap company in India. Conservative and risk averse investors can start investing in large cap funds. These funds carry less risk and offer modest returns.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Midcap funds</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Midcap funds invest mostly in medium-sized companies. Their rise and fall, both could occur at a scorching space. But these companies may successfully grow over a period of time and provide handsome returns to investors. Investors with the ability to take considerable risks should bet on these funds.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Smallcap funds</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Smallcap funds invest in small companies. Investing in these companies over short term could be perilous unless backed by substantial research and credible experience. However, they can also offer phenomenal return over a longer duration of time. They are appropriate only for investors with a significantly high-risk appetite.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Sector funds</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Sector funds invest only in businesses which are operating in a particular sector. For example, a Pharma themed fund will only invest in Pharmaceutical companies. As investments are directed towards a specific sector or theme, sector funds are considered extremely risky. Timing the entry into and exit from these sectoral funds is imperative as some of these sectors are cyclical. They are meant for investors with deep knowledge about a specific sector. It is advisable for investors to only take marginal positions in these funds.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hgroup>\\r\\n\\t<h4><strong>Should I be investing a little every-month? Or should I invest at one go?</strong></h4>\\r\\n</hgroup>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>SIP, which is an acronym for Systematic Investment Plan, is the most popular method of investing regularly in mutual funds as it enables an investor to take advantage of the market’s volatility. It is also easier on the pocket as an investor can begin investing with an amount that is as low as Rs 500 every month. Enabling a systematic investment plan will ensure that an investor is also able to adhere to a discipline of investing consistently during the ups and downs of stock market.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hgroup>\\r\\n\\t<h4><strong>How to select a Mutual Fund</strong></h4>\\r\\n</hgroup>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>SIP, which is an acronym for&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/beginners-guide-to-mutual-funds.html#\\\" title=\\\"Systematic Investment Plan\\\">Systematic Investment Plan</a>, is the most popular method of investing regularly in mutual funds as it enables an investor to take advantage of the market’s volatility.

Enabling a systematic investment plan will ensure that an investor is also able to adhere to a discipline of investing consistently during the ups and downs of stock market.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Consider the Portfolio Manager</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Now a days it is not very difficult to dig out information about your fund’s portfolio manager. You should also look at the performance of other funds which he is managing. If you find yourself holding a mutual fund with a manager that has discouraging, little or no track record you should consider exiting the investment.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Rankings</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Certain investors carefully scrutinize the star ratings given by various research agencies. These star ratings can be one of the factors to look at, but more than the recent or long-term performance of any scheme its ranking among peers should be looked at. One should select the scheme which has remained in top quartile most of the time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Past performance</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Investors should avoid investing by evaluating only the latest performance of a mutual fund. One should look for consistency in performance over longer tenures like 3, 5 and 10 years, if that is available, rather than the short-term returns. One must choose schemes that have consistently beaten benchmark indices (index to which a fund's returns are compared) and compare reasonably with their peer set over the above time frames.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hgroup>\\r\\n\\t<h4><strong>How to begin investing</strong></h4>\\r\\n</hgroup>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Mutual fund schemes offer regular and direct plans. A regular plan involves investing through a distributor/broker/agent. However, a direct investor must understand if the scheme is appropriate, considering its track record, the investor’s goal and risk profile.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>There are various online platforms for investing</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Transaction portal on the mutual fund website.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Transaction portals belonging to registrar and transfer agents of mutual funds.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Transaction portals of the distributor or agent</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>When to sell / redeem</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>When goals are achieved</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is ideal to sell one’s MF holdings on the eve of achieving one’s financial goals. Or probably a couple of years before that. It is advisable to shift one’s invested corpus from an equity fund to a low risk debt fund when one is a couple of years away from reaching the goal. This is to ensure that a sudden phase of volatility in the stock market does not upset one’s financial plan. For example, you might have invested in an equity-oriented mutual fund whose returns have fallen as the market has tumbled.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>If Mutual fund is not performing well</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When we talk of underperformance we are referring to consistent underperformance. Even the best of funds tends to have a few bad quarters. That is why it is always better to focus on three to five year returns on mutual funds. But then there are some genuine cases of underperformance. For example, your funds may be exposed to the wrong sectors at the wrong time. Alternatively, your debt fund may have taken too much risk on low quality debt without the associated benefit of outperforming the benchmark. If your equity mutual fund is yielding lower than an index fund, then you are actually earning negative yields on your market risk. That does not make sense. There are occasions when the fund returns have been too volatile which again defeats the purpose of MF investing. These are cases you must look to exit and reinvest in alternate funds.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Past performance</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Investors should avoid investing by evaluating only the latest performance of a mutual fund. One should look for consistency in performance over longer tenures like 3, 5 and 10 years, if that is available, rather than the short-term returns. One must choose schemes that have consistently beaten benchmark indices (index to which a fund's returns are compared) and compare reasonably with their peer set over the above time frames.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Documentation</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Like any other financial transaction, mutual fund investment it is not devoid of documentation. The investor will need to complete the following activities.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Application form: You may need to fill in an application form to open a mutual fund account and another form if you are going for an electronic transfer from your bank account.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>KYC Compliance: PAN has to be verified under the Know Your Customer (KYC) norms to be able to invest in mutual funds.

They offer diversification of assets as per individual’s objective, professional management and liquidity, at the same time allowing investors to avail benefits from the lower trading cost. A mutual fund is professionally managed and always keep aside some part of the money as cash to fulfil redemptions. Every investor gets to participate by holding units or shares that are proportional to the amount invested. The gains recorded by a mutual fund are distributed correspondingly among investors after deducting certain expenses.</p>\\n\\n<hgroup>\\n\\t<h4><strong>Why should one invest in Mutual Funds?</strong></h4>\\n\\n\\t<h5>To enjoy better returns</h5>\\n</hgroup>\\n\\n<p><strong>The best performing <a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/investment\\\" title=\\\"Mutual Fund\\\">mutual funds</a> have offered returns of anywhere between 15% to 20% consistently over the last 2 decades. An individual who would have invested Rs 10,000 every month would be able to create a corpus of Rs 27,86,573 assuming a CAGR of 15% But if we extrapolate this case to 20 years, the individual ends up with a corpus of almost Rs 1.5 crores.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Very few asset classes are able to match up to such returns. And what is the icing on the cake?</p>\\n\\n<h5>Liquidity!</h5>\\n\\n<p>You can redeem your mutual fund units anytime you wish. The redemption time varies between 1-2 working days for debt-oriented funds and 4-5 days for equity-oriented funds.</p>\\n\\n<h5>Accurate selling price</h5>\\n\\n<p>During the redemption, mutual fund units will be sold according to the NAV as on that day. Which means you get exactly what your investment is worth.</p>\\n\\n<h5>Inflation beating returns</h5>\\n\\n<p>What costs Rs 2 lakhs today, would cost Rs 4 lakhs after nine years considering an inflation rate of 8%. Most asset classes are not able to beat inflation effectively. Mutual Funds offer inflation beating returns consistently over a period of time.</p>\\n\\n<h5>Goal based investing</h5>\\n\\n<p>People have several goals in life. They wish to buy latest gadgets, travel to exotic destinations, purchase an automobile with all the bells and whistles, buy a house, educate their children in the best universities and hopefully – retire early! <br />\\nThese goals can be primarily divided into short term, medium term and long term. <br />\\nChoosing the right type of fund is critical to ensure that your financial goals are achieved.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Short Term Goal</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>One can invest in debt-oriented funds to prepare for achieving short term goals. These funds are less volatile and offer steady returns as they primarily are invested in government securities, bonds and other debt instruments. If one’s investment horizon is less than 2 years, debt oriented mutual funds are recommended.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Medium Term Goal</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Medium term goals may require an investment duration of 3 to 6 years. Balanced funds, which invest in a comfortable mix of equity and debt instruments, are most suitable to help an investor achieve medium term goals.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Long Term Goal</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Long term goals may require an investment duration of more than 7 years. One can consider equity-oriented funds as these invest heavily in equities. The time frame is also such that the fund can take advantage of market volatility to offer attractive returns.</p>\\n\\n<hgroup>\\n\\t<h4><strong>Different types of Mutual Funds</strong></h4>\\n\\n\\t<h5>How does one decide which type of mutual fund to invest in?</h5>\\n</hgroup>\\n\\n<p>One can choose a mutual fund scheme based on one’s investment duration, objective and risk appetite.</p>\\n\\n<h5>Based on maturity or investment duration!</h5>\\n\\n<p>Depending on its maturity period, a mutual fund scheme can be classified into open-ended scheme or close-ended scheme.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Open-ended Fund/ Scheme</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>As the name suggest, an open-ended fund or scheme is one that is available for subscription and sale on a continuous basis. These schemes do not have a fixed maturity period. Investors can conveniently buy and sell units at Net Asset Value (NAV) which are declared on a daily basis. The key feature of open-end schemes is liquidity.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Close-ended Fund/ Scheme</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>A close-ended fund or scheme has a maturity period that is clearly specified. When the scheme is launched, the fund is open for subscription only during a prescribed period. Thereafter investors can buy or sell the units of the scheme on the stock exchanges as they would do in case of any other listed security. To enable investors to exit, some close-ended funds offer an option of selling back the units to the mutual fund through periodic repurchase at NAV related prices.</p>\\n\\n<h5>Based on objective &gt; Receiving Creating a corpus or Regular Income – Growth or Dividend</h5>\\n\\n<p>One’s investment objective may also determine the type of fund which one would have to shortlist:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Growth Funds</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Growth funds usually put a huge portion in shares and growth sectors, suitable for investors who have a surplus of idle money to be distributed in riskier plans (albeit with possibly high returns) and can wait over a period of time.</p>\\n\\n<p>This will also require the investment horizon to be longer as volatile markets may cause adverse movement in value of these funds and hence there may not be immediate or steady returns.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Dividend Funds</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>For investors who seek to earn a regular income, dividend funds are best suited. However, there is a difference in the dividends that are offered by stocks and by mutual funds. In the case of stocks, dividends are earnings generated by a company (usually profits) that are distributed amongst shareholders. This is besides the appreciation in share price of a stock. Whereas in the case of a dividend mutual fund, a small chunk of the units or shares of the mutual fund are sold at a price which is higher than the purchase price to earn dividends. The dividend pay-outs can be monthly, quarterly or yearly. Depending on the fund, the dividend can also be re-invested.</p>\\n\\n<h5>Based on Risk Appetite</h5>\\n\\n<p>Risk appetite is also a function of investment goals. A retired citizen who is investing for regular monthly income would have a different risk appetite from someone who is investing with horizon of a decade for buying a house.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Index funds mirror an index.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>These funds will purchase stocks in the same proportion in which they comprise an index. For instance, if a particular stock forms 2% of an index which is being followed by a mutual fund, the mutual fund will invest 2% of its investible corpus in that particular stock. The performance of an index fund will more or less mimic that of the index which it follows except for a difference that would creep up, known as tracking error. Expenses incurred by an index fund are lower as compared to other types of mutual funds.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Balanced funds are also known as hybrid funds. These are primarily of two types: Equity Oriented Funds and Debt Oriented Funds.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Equity-oriented funds</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Equity-oriented funds invest a mix of equity (at least 65 per cent of the corpus) and debt. These funds offer attractive returns over a longer period of time but returns can be highly volatile in the short term. These funds are suitable for investors who can deal with the risk and have a longer investment horizon.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Debt-oriented funds</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>are low risk funds that primarily invest in highly rated corporate bonds and stable government bonds. They offer steady returns and are suitable for conservative investors.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Equity Linked Savings Schemes</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Equity Linked Savings Schemes make it possible for investors to claim upto Rs 1.5 lakhs as tax deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act while creating a corpus! However, an investor cannot withdraw money before 3 years as this scheme has a mandatory lock in period.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Largecap Funds</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Largecap funds invest mostly in big companies. Funds identify these companies by their market capitalisation. These companies are well established and have immense credibility. They are most likely to be among the top names in their respective sector. Although there is no fixed nomenclature, a company whose market cap is more than Rs 10,000 crores is considered to be a large cap company in India. Conservative and risk averse investors can start investing in large cap funds. These funds carry less risk and offer modest returns.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Midcap funds</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Midcap funds invest mostly in medium-sized companies. Their rise and fall, both could occur at a scorching space. But these companies may successfully grow over a period of time and provide handsome returns to investors. Investors with the ability to take considerable risks should bet on these funds.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Smallcap funds</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Smallcap funds invest in small companies. Investing in these companies over short term could be perilous unless backed by substantial research and credible experience. However, they can also offer phenomenal return over a longer duration of time. They are appropriate only for investors with a significantly high-risk appetite.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Sector funds</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Sector funds invest only in businesses which are operating in a particular sector. For example, a Pharma themed fund will only invest in Pharmaceutical companies. As investments are directed towards a specific sector or theme, sector funds are considered extremely risky. Timing the entry into and exit from these sectoral funds is imperative as some of these sectors are cyclical. They are meant for investors with deep knowledge about a specific sector. It is advisable for investors to only take marginal positions in these funds.</p>\\n\\n<hgroup>\\n\\t<h4><strong>Should I be investing a little every-month? Or should I invest at one go?</strong></h4>\\n</hgroup>\\n\\n<p>SIP, which is an acronym for Systematic Investment Plan, is the most popular method of investing regularly in mutual funds as it enables an investor to take advantage of the market’s volatility. It is also easier on the pocket as an investor can begin investing with an amount that is as low as Rs 500 every month. Enabling a systematic investment plan will ensure that an investor is also able to adhere to a discipline of investing consistently during the ups and downs of stock market.</p>\\n\\n<hgroup>\\n\\t<h4><strong>How to select a Mutual Fund</strong></h4>\\n</hgroup>\\n\\n<p>SIP, which is an acronym for <a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/beginners-guide-to-mutual-funds.html#\\\" title=\\\"Systematic Investment Plan\\\">Systematic Investment Plan</a>, is the most popular method of investing regularly in mutual funds as it enables an investor to take advantage of the market’s volatility.

You should also look at the performance of other funds which he is managing. If you find yourself holding a mutual fund with a manager that has discouraging, little or no track record you should consider exiting the investment.</p>\\n\\n<h5>Rankings</h5>\\n\\n<p>Certain investors carefully scrutinize the star ratings given by various research agencies. These star ratings can be one of the factors to look at, but more than the recent or long-term performance of any scheme its ranking among peers should be looked at. One should select the scheme which has remained in top quartile most of the time.</p>\\n\\n<h5>Past performance</h5>\\n\\n<p>Investors should avoid investing by evaluating only the latest performance of a mutual fund. One should look for consistency in performance over longer tenures like 3, 5 and 10 years, if that is available, rather than the short-term returns.

For beginners, and for many seasoned investors as well, Mutual Funds is a better option than building an investment portfolio themselves. This is because when investing in a mutual fund, you get the benefit of the expertise of a professional funds manager and the scale without having to either do the leg work yourself or investing a large corpus.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>In a sense, investing in a mutual fund is like riding a train – you need not know how the train runs, the route it needs to take or how to drive it. All you have to do is buy the ticket to your destination and get off the train once it reaches there.</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The regulators have not mandated any minimum age to invest in a mutual fund. In fact, even young kids can open an investment account and buy into mutual funds with the money they receive as gifts on their birthday or festivals. Obviously, there is no upper age either – whatever age you are, you can benefit from investing in mutual funds.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Of course, not all investors have the same investment goals. Therefore, they cannot make the same investments. Mutual Funds come in different flavours just for this reason. You can choose to invest in funds that aim for safety with regular income or those that go for taking on more risks for higher returns or those that provide highest liquidity, based on your investment goals and other investments that you have already made.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hgroup>\\r\\n\\t<h4><strong>Best mode of investment – Systematic Investment Plan</strong></h4>\\r\\n</hgroup>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Once you have decided that you would like to invest in mutual funds, you must decide how to go about it. You would have heard it said that the best time to enter the market is when it has hit rock bottom – buy low, sell high. This is called timing the market. But for most beginners and casual investors it is impossible to monitor the market long enough to achieve this. Further, you may not have a huge lumpsum amount at hand to invest and take advantage of such an opportunity. Further, since you will be investing in a funds, and not piecemeal stocks, all the stocks that make up the fund will never be at the rock bottom together – and if they are, then the fund is not diversified enough anyways, and you may want to reconsider investing in it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An alternative that suits most investors is known as systematic investment plan or SIP. SIP involves making fixed, periodic investment into the mutual fund of your choice. Typically, the periodicity is once a month, but you can choose to invest once per quarter, or even per fortnight or per week. Doing this ensures that your buying price is averaged over a long period – and therefore, you do not have to worry about timing the market or think about whether the market is bearish or bullish. As the amount to be invested every period is fixed, SIP ensures that you purchase more units when the market is down and NAV is lower than average, and lesser units when market is bullish and NAV is higher than average.

If you choose to reinvest any returns that you get from the funds in the form of dividends, etc. The compounding effect over the years would add up to a significantly high value.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hgroup>\\r\\n\\t<h4><strong>Other Important aspects to consider to decide when to start investing</strong></h4>\\r\\n</hgroup>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While it is true that the best time start investing is right now, there are a few aspects you should consider before you start investing. These will decide how much you should invest and what flavour of mutual fund would best suit your requirement. These include</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Stable source of income</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When you plan to make an investment, especially through a systematic investment plan as suggested here, it is important that you have a stable source of income to fund these investments. Remember that you need to meet your day to day expenses without having to dip into the investment that you are making – and this is only possible if you have a stable source of income. Note that you need only worry about your income being stable – not high. No income is too low to invest. In fact, many a young people make the mistake of not making investments early in their career believing they will do so when they have a higher disposable income. This is a wrong approach! You should invest at least 10% of your monthly income, regardless of how large your income is and plan to meet all your other expenses with the rest of your income. Cut down on your expenses today, rather than on your investments. The single biggest predictor of success in life is not IQ, but the ability to postpone gratification – avoid making purchases today to invest and you will be able to make much bigger purchases later in life.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Risk Appetite</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Your choice of investment will depend directly on how much risk you can take. It is generally considered that a youngster can take much more risk than someone close to retirement, considering all else is equal – as the youngster has more time for the risk to payoff compared to latter. Your risk appetite also depends on how what the rest of your portfolio looks like. For example, if all your other investments are in the F&amp;O space, you should look for low-risk mutual funds that are virtually loss free and guarantee a safe return. On the other hand, if you are already invested in instruments like PPF and fixed deposits, you can choose to invest in high-risk, high0return funds that aim to maximize returns over a short period.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Goals</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Before you make your investments, you have to be clear on what your goals are. Unless you know why you are making an investment, you will not be able to decide where the investment should be, and when you should exit. For example, if you are aiming to build a retirement fund with your retirement close to 20 years away, you can choose mutual funds with a long-term horizon and with focus on FDs and other safe instruments. On the other hand, if you are looking to save money for a car that you will like to buy 5 years down the line – a shorter term horizon with focus on equity with strong fundamentals may be a better choice.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Stage in life (Single/Married etc)</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Stage in life that you are in has a direct impact on both your risk appetite and goals. As pointed out earlier, someone who is still single and just starting out his career can take higher risks than someone with a child and already approaching mid-life. Life-stage could also decide the time horizon you can work with. For example, if you have a child today – you have about 16 years to build a corpus for his higher education. You may also want to save monies for your child’s wedding that may take place about 25 years from now. The 9 to 10 year difference in these two events means that you can choose to make different kinds of investment choices for each of these. On the other hand, an emergency fund needs to be available as soon as possible and you need to make sure that the investments that you make for such a fund remains liquid so as you can turn it into cash on very short notice.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h5>Planning for tax savings</h5>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>None of us want to pay more tax than strictly required. One of the ways to save on income tax is through savings that qualify for a deduction under section 80C of the Income Tax Act. While tax savings should not be the sole reason for your investment decision, it does create a lower bound on the amount you want to invest in tax saving schemes. Many funds are built with a specific focus on tax-efficiency, like the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitpl-mf-designs/hari/mf-campaign/saveTaxELSS/lp-save-tax-elss.html\\\" title=\\\"Equity Linked Saving Schemes\\\">Equity Linked Saving Schemes</a>(ELSS). With an eye on tax savings, you can choose to invest via a SIP in ELSS funds, or you could also do so in a lumpsum at the start of the year. While doing so at the end of the year would have the same impact on your tax liability, it is better to make your investments as early as possible to avoid any last-minute rush resulting in poor choice of investment.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hgroup>\\r\\n\\t<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>\\r\\n</hgroup>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Investing in mutual funds generally makes for a good return in the long run. If you have not yet started investing in mutual funds, you should not delay it anymore. Once you have considered the factors listed earlier, and decided on the flavour of mutual fund you would like to invest in – the best way forward is to build a systematic investment plan with a periodicity and quantum of investment that will let you achieve your goals. Remember that you do not invest what is left over after you have covered other expenses, but you spend what is left over after you have made your investments towards the goals you wish to achieve.</p>\\r\\n\",\r\n                \"format\": \"full_html\",\r\n                \"processed\": \"<p>There is never a good reason to postpone starting your investments – other than, of course, not having the money to invest. For beginners, and for many seasoned investors as well, Mutual Funds is a better option than building an investment portfolio themselves. This is because when investing in a mutual fund, you get the benefit of the expertise of a professional funds manager and the scale without having to either do the leg work yourself or investing a large corpus.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>In a sense, investing in a mutual fund is like riding a train – you need not know how the train runs, the route it needs to take or how to drive it. All you have to do is buy the ticket to your destination and get off the train once it reaches there.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>The regulators have not mandated any minimum age to invest in a mutual fund. In fact, even young kids can open an investment account and buy into mutual funds with the money they receive as gifts on their birthday or festivals. Obviously, there is no upper age either – whatever age you are, you can benefit from investing in mutual funds.</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course, not all investors have the same investment goals. Therefore, they cannot make the same investments. Mutual Funds come in different flavours just for this reason. You can choose to invest in funds that aim for safety with regular income or those that go for taking on more risks for higher returns or those that provide highest liquidity, based on your investment goals and other investments that you have already made.</p>\\n\\n<hgroup>\\n\\t<h4><strong>Best mode of investment – Systematic Investment Plan</strong></h4>\\n</hgroup>\\n\\n<p>Once you have decided that you would like to invest in mutual funds, you must decide how to go about it. You would have heard it said that the best time to enter the market is when it has hit rock bottom – buy low, sell high. This is called timing the market. But for most beginners and casual investors it is impossible to monitor the market long enough to achieve this. Further, you may not have a huge lumpsum amount at hand to invest and take advantage of such an opportunity. Further, since you will be investing in a funds, and not piecemeal stocks, all the stocks that make up the fund will never be at the rock bottom together – and if they are, then the fund is not diversified enough anyways, and you may want to reconsider investing in it.</p>\\n\\n<p>An alternative that suits most investors is known as systematic investment plan or SIP. SIP involves making fixed, periodic investment into the mutual fund of your choice. Typically, the periodicity is once a month, but you can choose to invest once per quarter, or even per fortnight or per week. Doing this ensures that your buying price is averaged over a long period – and therefore, you do not have to worry about timing the market or think about whether the market is bearish or bullish. As the amount to be invested every period is fixed, SIP ensures that you purchase more units when the market is down and NAV is lower than average, and lesser units when market is bullish and NAV is higher than average. Over the long-term, this ensures that the average cost per unit remains low.</p>\\n\\n<p>Further, the <a href=\\\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitpl-mf-designs/hari/MFBlog/SIP-or-systematic-investment-plan.html\\\" title=\\\"Advantage of SIP\\\">advantage of SIP </a>is that you do not have to make a large investment at one go.

I have stated the most important ones below:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Retirement planning –</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Let us assume there are two investor, A &amp; B. They start working at the age of 20.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Investor A starts investing Rs. 1000/- per month right from the start of his career for the next 10 years. That’s a total investment of Rs. 1,20,000/-. He leaves the investment in the market for next 30years, until he is 60 years old.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Investor B starts investing after initial 10 years of his career. But to build a nest he starts investing Rs.1000/- per month for the next 30 years. That’s a total investment of Rs. 3,60,000/-.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Assuming a market return of 8% p.a., who do you think would have a larger retirement fund at the age of 60.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Investor A has contributed a lot less than Investor B, but due to the power of compounding, Investor A has a retirement nest of Rs. 20,13,000/- whereas Investor B has managed to accumulate a wealth of Rs. 15,00,000/-.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This is the power of compounding and starting early towards long term goals even with relatively smaller amounts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Children’s Education –</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Education is the key to unlocking the world, a passport to freedom” – Oprah Winfrey.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Every parent wants the best for their children and rightfully so. Education has always held a special significance in our lives and we always believed that good education is the key to success and don’t we all want our kids to be more successful that ourselves.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Thankfully to achieve our goal, today we have multiple options in the field of education that we can provide to our children. However, these options are expensive.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So, what can help us provide for our kids college enrolment?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We need to plan through a multiple step process:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Calculate the time horizon, the time remaining to enrol the child for graduate or post graduate course.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Estimate the cost of education – the future cost not the current cost. Many people forget to factor in the evils of inflation while estimating the future cost of education. If the current cost of a post graduate course is Rs, 5,00,000/- and your child will be eligible for that course in 10 years time, then assuming an inflation rate of 5%, the likely cost of the course in 10 years would be Rs 8,14,447/-. So, we would need to provide for Rs 8,14,000/-.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Once we know the cost of education, we need to determine how much we need to save monthly to achieve this goal. The earlier we start the lower the amount required to the saved per month. In the above example, investing Rs 3000 per month for 10 years would help one create a corpus of around Rs 8.4 lakhs at a CAGR of 15%.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What kind of funds are suitable for retirement planning and children education goals?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To start with, both retirement and children’s education, need to planned much in advance. Since the time frame for these goals is minimum 8-10 years, you can invest in equity funds. One can start by investing aggressive small cap and large cap equity funds. These funds have higher exposure to equity and hence could have volatile returns. However over a longer period of time, these funds also provide higher returns.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>1. Large Cap Funds invest in large-cap companies. The stock prices of these companies are considerably stable compared to overall market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>2. Small-Cap Fund is extremely vulnerable to market ups and downs and carry higher risk. However, the reward for choosing higher risk is the attractive returns.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As we get closer to the college enrolment date or retirement age, we should start allocating some funds out of these small cap and large cap equity funds into balanced funds to reduce volatility towards the end. A strategy that gradually grows more conservative over time requires that us regularly rebalance the portfolio and ease up on your stock weighting as you get closer to our goal.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Medium Term Goals</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One could ask, why do one need mutual funds for buying a house? That’s what mortgage loans are for. Well the loan to value ratio for mortgages is max of 75% for any home loan above Rs 75,00,000/. So, one needs to provide a substantial amount for down payment. Plus we have stamp duties and registration charges to be covered. This may require a lump sum amount which may need to be planned 4-6years in advance.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Another medium-term goal could a self owned car which we may have set our eyes on when we started working at the age of 20 with a target of buying the same before we reach 25 years of age. Such goals need same financial planning and regular savings which need to be invested to generate returns.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To achieve such medium term goals, you can take calculated risks by making investments in a balanced fund. When one opts for a balanced fund, their money gets invested in debt and equity instruments together. The debt portion works as a cushion and covers the impact if the equity portion is unable to reap great rewards. However, a combination of debt and equity largely increases the investor’s chances of reaping attractive returns with just a fair percentage of risk.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Short Term Goals</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While investing for longer term you are looking for capital appreciation and hence can take risk volatility of returns on your capital in near term but if the investment horizon is short term then the objective is more about safety over growth. You also need to ensure liquidity of your investment at the right time also matters when it comes to investing for short term goal or emergency fund.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While considering investment avenues for short term goals typically traditional instruments like fixed deposit pop up. Bank fixed deposit have been the first choice so long primarily because it does not fluctuate your capital. However taxation (TDS is deducted on deposit interest) and cost of liquidating them before maturity gives a bigger blow when short term investments are considered.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Mutual funds have various categories of schemes that cater to short term investments which can help you in meeting your short term goals like planning for holidays or wedding or buying electronic gadgets or house renovation to name a few. These are goals with typically 1-3 target date.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Here too, the goal can impact the choice of short-term funds:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>For very short-term goals and for emergency fund you have to invest in liquid funds or ultra-short-term funds as emergency fund is a corpus which you may need immediately as and when emergency arises and hence liquidity and minimal exit load are critical drivers. These are funds that invest primarily into money market or short tenure liquid instruments but provide the flexibility to redeem the funds at short notice with minimal or no exit load.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>If your goal is 3 years away, you can invest in an income fund or dynamic bond fund. These funds typically invest in corporate paper and are able to generate higher returns than bank fixed deposits in most cases.<br />\\r\\n\\tMost importantly, unlike fixed deposits, no TDS is deducted on the interests earned in case of a Short-Term Debt Fund. Further Investors enjoy an indexation benefit when they invest in Debt Funds for a period exceeding 3 years. So even if the gross return is the same as Fixed deposits, these funds can provide higher post tax return depending upon the investors tax bracket.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Goal of Tax Saving</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As mentioned earlier, we need to start investing to achieve short term, medium term and long term goals simultaneously. The obvious question would be how is it achievable? Hence we feel the pressure to prioritize and for most of us retirement saving is typically the most ignored goal in our scheme of things as it appears distant and one does not feel a pressing urge to address it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>However, our desire to save tax every year can be channelled to help us achieve two goals with one investment: tax saving and investing for retirement.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) has turned out to be a popular tax saving and wealth creating instrument. While being an equity diversified fund, ELSS is riskier than the fixed-income-products available for tax-saving, ELSS has the shortest lock in and offers the potential of growth via equity. Thus, we can start to save for retirement by considering ELSS to achieve this as well as save tax under section 80C.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>ELSS has a lock in of 3 years from the date of investment post which the scheme turns open ended. Rather than redeeming, it makes sense for the fund to be invested to meet a pre-decided goal.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h4><strong>Goal of Regular Income</strong></h4>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We have discussed about starting early to build a retirement pool but have not discussed what does one do once we actually retire. Fluctuations in income from investments may not be desired post retirement as investment income could be the primary source of income. So regular income is of prime significance.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Mutual funds can provide regular income through 2 modes:</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Monthly Income plans option for a regular income involves&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/10-reasons-to-invest-in-a-mutual-fund.html\\\">investing in mutual funds</a>&nbsp;with a monthly divided option.

In the words of Mark Pincus, American Internet entrepreneur, ‘Not having a clear goal leads to death by a thousand compromises.’</p>\\n\\n<p>We all understand that we need to lay our goals in the pecking order, but we still get trapped into improvising our investments and being haphazard about it.

These investments are unlikely to mirror any of our goals.</p>\\n\\n<p>Warren Buffett once told his pilot that in order to reach his goals, he needed to do three things.

Should you be tempted to go for it?

Setting investing goals reveals the amount of investment needed for a specified tenure to yield the desired corpus. We achieve clarity on how much do we need for eventualities, for fulfilling monthly requisite SIPs and when to redeem from mutual funds as our goals near. And we thereby stop following the herd.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Let us look at the type of goals most of us have as a household:</strong></h4>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/how-mutual-funds-will-help-you-achieve-your-goals.html#long_term_goals\\\">Long term goals</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/how-mutual-funds-will-help-you-achieve-your-goals.html#medium_term_goals\\\">Medium term goals</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/how-mutual-funds-will-help-you-achieve-your-goals.html#short_term_goals\\\">Short term goals</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/how-mutual-funds-will-help-you-achieve-your-goals.html#goal_of_tax_saving\\\">Goal of Tax saving</a></li>\\n\\t<li><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/how-mutual-funds-will-help-you-achieve-your-goals.html#goal_of_regular_income\\\">Goal of Regular Income</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Before elaborating each goal, let us understand the what and why about goals.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Long Term Goals LONG TERM GOALS</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>There are various types of long term goals. I have stated the most important ones below:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Retirement planning –</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Let us assume there are two investor, A &amp; B. They start working at the age of 20.</p>\\n\\n<p>Investor A starts investing Rs. 1000/- per month right from the start of his career for the next 10 years. That’s a total investment of Rs. 1,20,000/-. He leaves the investment in the market for next 30years, until he is 60 years old.</p>\\n\\n<p>Investor B starts investing after initial 10 years of his career. But to build a nest he starts investing Rs.1000/- per month for the next 30 years. That’s a total investment of Rs. 3,60,000/-.</p>\\n\\n<p>Assuming a market return of 8% p.a., who do you think would have a larger retirement fund at the age of 60.</p>\\n\\n<p>Investor A has contributed a lot less than Investor B, but due to the power of compounding, Investor A has a retirement nest of Rs. 20,13,000/- whereas Investor B has managed to accumulate a wealth of Rs. 15,00,000/-.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is the power of compounding and starting early towards long term goals even with relatively smaller amounts.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Children’s Education –</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>“Education is the key to unlocking the world, a passport to freedom” – Oprah Winfrey.</p>\\n\\n<p>Every parent wants the best for their children and rightfully so. Education has always held a special significance in our lives and we always believed that good education is the key to success and don’t we all want our kids to be more successful that ourselves.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thankfully to achieve our goal, today we have multiple options in the field of education that we can provide to our children. However, these options are expensive.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, what can help us provide for our kids college enrolment?</p>\\n\\n<p>We need to plan through a multiple step process:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n\\t<li>Calculate the time horizon, the time remaining to enrol the child for graduate or post graduate course.</li>\\n\\t<li>Estimate the cost of education – the future cost not the current cost. Many people forget to factor in the evils of inflation while estimating the future cost of education. If the current cost of a post graduate course is Rs, 5,00,000/- and your child will be eligible for that course in 10 years time, then assuming an inflation rate of 5%, the likely cost of the course in 10 years would be Rs 8,14,447/-. So, we would need to provide for Rs 8,14,000/-.</li>\\n\\t<li>Once we know the cost of education, we need to determine how much we need to save monthly to achieve this goal. The earlier we start the lower the amount required to the saved per month. In the above example, investing Rs 3000 per month for 10 years would help one create a corpus of around Rs 8.4 lakhs at a CAGR of 15%.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n<p>What kind of funds are suitable for retirement planning and children education goals?</p>\\n\\n<p>To start with, both retirement and children’s education, need to planned much in advance. Since the time frame for these goals is minimum 8-10 years, you can invest in equity funds. One can start by investing aggressive small cap and large cap equity funds. These funds have higher exposure to equity and hence could have volatile returns. However over a longer period of time, these funds also provide higher returns.</p>\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n\\t<li>1. Large Cap Funds invest in large-cap companies. The stock prices of these companies are considerably stable compared to overall market.</li>\\n\\t<li>2. Small-Cap Fund is extremely vulnerable to market ups and downs and carry higher risk. However, the reward for choosing higher risk is the attractive returns.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n<p>As we get closer to the college enrolment date or retirement age, we should start allocating some funds out of these small cap and large cap equity funds into balanced funds to reduce volatility towards the end. A strategy that gradually grows more conservative over time requires that us regularly rebalance the portfolio and ease up on your stock weighting as you get closer to our goal.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Medium Term Goals</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>One could ask, why do one need mutual funds for buying a house? That’s what mortgage loans are for. Well the loan to value ratio for mortgages is max of 75% for any home loan above Rs 75,00,000/. So, one needs to provide a substantial amount for down payment. Plus we have stamp duties and registration charges to be covered. This may require a lump sum amount which may need to be planned 4-6years in advance.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another medium-term goal could a self owned car which we may have set our eyes on when we started working at the age of 20 with a target of buying the same before we reach 25 years of age. Such goals need same financial planning and regular savings which need to be invested to generate returns.</p>\\n\\n<p>To achieve such medium term goals, you can take calculated risks by making investments in a balanced fund. When one opts for a balanced fund, their money gets invested in debt and equity instruments together. The debt portion works as a cushion and covers the impact if the equity portion is unable to reap great rewards. However, a combination of debt and equity largely increases the investor’s chances of reaping attractive returns with just a fair percentage of risk.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Short Term Goals</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>While investing for longer term you are looking for capital appreciation and hence can take risk volatility of returns on your capital in near term but if the investment horizon is short term then the objective is more about safety over growth. You also need to ensure liquidity of your investment at the right time also matters when it comes to investing for short term goal or emergency fund.</p>\\n\\n<p>While considering investment avenues for short term goals typically traditional instruments like fixed deposit pop up. Bank fixed deposit have been the first choice so long primarily because it does not fluctuate your capital. However taxation (TDS is deducted on deposit interest) and cost of liquidating them before maturity gives a bigger blow when short term investments are considered.</p>\\n\\n<p>Mutual funds have various categories of schemes that cater to short term investments which can help you in meeting your short term goals like planning for holidays or wedding or buying electronic gadgets or house renovation to name a few. These are goals with typically 1-3 target date.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here too, the goal can impact the choice of short-term funds:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n\\t<li>For very short-term goals and for emergency fund you have to invest in liquid funds or ultra-short-term funds as emergency fund is a corpus which you may need immediately as and when emergency arises and hence liquidity and minimal exit load are critical drivers. These are funds that invest primarily into money market or short tenure liquid instruments but provide the flexibility to redeem the funds at short notice with minimal or no exit load.</li>\\n\\t<li>If your goal is 3 years away, you can invest in an income fund or dynamic bond fund. These funds typically invest in corporate paper and are able to generate higher returns than bank fixed deposits in most cases.<br />\\n\\tMost importantly, unlike fixed deposits, no TDS is deducted on the interests earned in case of a Short-Term Debt Fund. Further Investors enjoy an indexation benefit when they invest in Debt Funds for a period exceeding 3 years. So even if the gross return is the same as Fixed deposits, these funds can provide higher post tax return depending upon the investors tax bracket.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Goal of Tax Saving</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>As mentioned earlier, we need to start investing to achieve short term, medium term and long term goals simultaneously. The obvious question would be how is it achievable? Hence we feel the pressure to prioritize and for most of us retirement saving is typically the most ignored goal in our scheme of things as it appears distant and one does not feel a pressing urge to address it.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, our desire to save tax every year can be channelled to help us achieve two goals with one investment: tax saving and investing for retirement.</p>\\n\\n<p>Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) has turned out to be a popular tax saving and wealth creating instrument. While being an equity diversified fund, ELSS is riskier than the fixed-income-products available for tax-saving, ELSS has the shortest lock in and offers the potential of growth via equity. Thus, we can start to save for retirement by considering ELSS to achieve this as well as save tax under section 80C.</p>\\n\\n<p>ELSS has a lock in of 3 years from the date of investment post which the scheme turns open ended. Rather than redeeming, it makes sense for the fund to be invested to meet a pre-decided goal.</p>\\n\\n<h4><strong>Goal of Regular Income</strong></h4>\\n\\n<p>We have discussed about starting early to build a retirement pool but have not discussed what does one do once we actually retire. Fluctuations in income from investments may not be desired post retirement as investment income could be the primary source of income. So regular income is of prime significance.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Mutual funds can provide regular income through 2 modes:</strong></p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n\\t<li>Monthly Income plans option for a regular income involves <a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/10-reasons-to-invest-in-a-mutual-fund.html\\\">investing in mutual funds</a> with a monthly divided option. Most of these funds allocate only 10-20% of their corpus into equities and the rest 80-90% in safer bonds and other debt instruments.<br />\\n\\t<br />\\n\\tMIP presents relative safety as these funds offer investors good returns if stock markets do well, but they also protect the downside because of the limited exposure to equities. <br />\\n\\t<br />\\n\\tHowever, there is no assurance of monthly income.

But that is a misconception. Most mutual funds enable you to begin investing with as low as Rs 500 per month. One can purchase three movie tickets or maybe a couple of pizzas with this amount. Young adults in college end up saving this much after spending their pocket money.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One would be tempted to feel it is an insignificant amount to begin one’s investing journey. But what if as a 20-year-old, you started investing Rs 500 per month?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Assuming a modest CAGR of 12% over 25 years, you would have created a corpus of close to Rs 9.5 lakhs when you are 40. If you share this insight with any 45-year-old today, they would wish they had learnt about it two decades back as Rs 9.5 lakhs is still a significant amount.Therefore, it is important to learn early as to Why should you invest in mutual funds?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Take advantage of market's volatility</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Volatility is the stock market’s ultimate truth. Before understanding how Mutual Funds take advantage of market volatility, let us understand the concept of market volatility. Volatility is the quantum of change a security’s price goes through during a given period of time. The change would be positive or negative depending on whether markets go up or down respectively.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When share prices fall, the mutual fund will purchase more units of shares. Individual investors keep waiting for the bottom and sometimes miss out on purchasing shares at mouth watering prices. However, through a regular SIP, investing regularly in mutual funds helps investors take advantage of rupee cost averaging – which means cost of purchasing units averages out over a longer period of time and reduces impact of short-term volatility on one’s investment. In simpler words, volatility ensures that there are opportunities for the mutual fund portfolio manager to buy units at cheaper prices which bumps up the return on investment over a longer period of time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Warren Buffet often quotes that over the long term, there's only one direction the market will go. BSE Sensex has given a compounded annual growth rate of 16% since 1979 till December 2017. Not to forget the biggest crashes like Harshad Mehta scandal in 1992 and the global financial crisis in 2008. The bottom-line is that even the worst crashes are rather resilient to long-term returns. A correction or a crash may not necessarily be a negative thing for a long term investor.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Prudent investors would avoid herd mentality. A common reason why investors are unhappy is when they see the stock market rising, they see many people booking profits. They also get greedy and cash in. Similarly, when there is crash, the same investors believe that it is a wise decision to sell and cut losses. Thus investors buy high and sell low, which negates the primary goal of investing. Hence, the most important quality for a long term investor is temperament and not intellect. This highlights another bottom-line - Don't panic, stay invested.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why should you invest in mutual funds? It helps inculcate financial discipline.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One of the most overlooked benefits of investing is inculcating a habit of regular savings. Individuals typically believe this -&gt; Amount to invest = Income – Expenses. Whereas it should actually be -&gt; Expenses = Income – Amount Invested. Systematic Investment Plans help inculcate a ‘saving habit’ as we invest a fixed sum at regular intervals and would spend the amount that remains after that.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Most investors aren’t aware that a SIP can be set up daily, monthly, quarterly or bi-annually.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The earlier one begins the better as good habits take time to form!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why should you invest in mutual funds? It helps you achieve goals</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Often, individuals get enticed by ad-hoc investing. Especially in products which promise amazing returns or claim to have incomparable features. These individuals find themselves with unwanted investments which are a result of making uninformed investment decisions. And when important milestones come up, the redeemed amount turns out to be woefully short.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Listing down goals and back calculating to figure out how much to invest regularly helps an individual to be financially and mentally prepared to achieve these goals when the time comes. This also reduces unnecessary stress which one may burden oneself with otherwise.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Goals can be primarily divided into short-term, medium term and long term.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Investments can be made in appropriate mutual funds to achieve all these different types of goals.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Setting proper goals shows us the exact investment amount needed for a duration in order to reach a specific corpus. We get clarity on how much monthly investment to make and when to sell mutual funds as and when our goals near.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why should you invest in mutual funds? It can be liquidated easily at market rate</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Mutual funds are liquid since investors can redeem their funds at any given point in time. The mutual fund units are sold as per market rates on the date of selling. The money gets credited in investors’ account within 1 – 2 working days in the case of liquid or debt funds whereas amount redeemed from equity mutual funds gets credited within 4 to 5 working days. However, it is applicable only to open ended schemes, which contribute to the major share of the mutual funds in India.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Close ended funds have lock-in period and the time horizon varies from funds to funds.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why should you invest in mutual funds?It offers inflation beating returns</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Let us try to understand what inflation is. Inflation is a silent thief. When the government publishes the rate of inflation @ 6%, this implies that the average cost of living for us has gone up by 6%. If we had to spend Rs. 100/- a month until last year, then we would spend Rs. 106/- a month this year. This implies keeping money stashed in lockers also looses value due to inflation as it is worth less today compared to last year when considered based on the goods or luxuries the same money can buy for us. This is typically the reason why our retirement pool more often than not seems insufficient at a later stage as people underestimate the impact of inflation.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What we need is an investment that provides a return higher than inflation rate so that our savings do not lose value over time. Example: If bank FDs give us 6% rate of interest, then Rs. 100/- invested last year would be worth Rs. 106/- today. This will allow us to buy the same set of goods that we could have purchased last year for Rs. 100/-.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But this is assuming there is no tax deducted at source as it would reduce our net return. Banks charge a TDS of 10% on the interest accrued if it is more than Rs 10,000 in a year.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Equity mutual funds, however, do provide an opportunity to generate inflation beating returns. While the returns do tend to be volatile in the short term, over a period of time, equity mutual funds have given a return of 12% to 15% which beats inflation. Even assuming a 10% long term capital gain tax on withdrawal of income, the net return would be adequate to beat inflation and put us in a comfortable position.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Why should you invest in mutual funds?It is hassle-free to invest.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/beginners-guide-to-mutual-funds.html\\\">Investing in Mutual Funds</a>&nbsp;has never been easier than it is today. Creating an account happens quickly if all documents such as application form, KYC, Proof of Identity and Proof of address are submitted properly. One can easily start a SIP, modify, top up or even cancel it. Thanks to online platforms, process of investing in a mutual fund can be completed quickly. One can monitor fund performance on a daily basis thanks to the exhaustive reports offered by these platforms. Most online platforms also have an APP which can be downloaded into a mobile device and accessed to perform any operation at the investor’s convenience.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Transfer of funds from bank account to the demat account offered by the platform also happens smoothly.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Variety of mutual funds to choose from according to investor profile and objective</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Have you just started working? Or wish to begin investing with your pocket money? Or are you at the prime of your career? Or does retirement beckon?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Do you wish to create a corpus to buy a house? Or do you want regular income? Or are you planning to save up for that solo trip?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Whatever an investor’s profile or objective might be, there will be a suitable mutual fund to consider. An investor</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>Mutual funds are broadly classified as Open-End Funds and Close-End Funds.</em></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Open ended is the type of mutual fund, that does not restrict the number of units issued by the fund. Investors can issue and redeem units continuously, since there is no limit on the issuance of number of open-end fund units.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Closed-ended funds are a type of funds that are not redeemable from the fund. Unlike open-end funds, which one can redeem at any given point, investors in closed ended funds commit their funds for the duration of the fund. At the time of New Fund offering, the AMC issues a specific number of shares based on the amount of money raised. No additions can be made thereafter.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><em>However, a goal based classification is into Growth funds and Income funds.</em></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Growth Funds:</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Growth funds usually put a huge portion in shares and growth sectors, suitable for investors who have a surplus of idle money to be distributed in riskier plans with high returns. This will also require the investment horizon to be longer as volatile markets may cause adverse movement in value of these funds and hence there may not be immediate or steady returns. Further investors looking for tax advantage may also consider investments in debt mutual funds so that they can use the indexation benefit as compared to fixed deposits.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Income Funds:</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This belongs to the family regular income plans mutual funds that distribute their money in a mix of bonds, certificate of deposits and securities among others with some allocation to equity to generate incremental returns.

But that is a misconception. Most mutual funds enable you to begin investing with as low as Rs 500 per month. One can purchase three movie tickets or maybe a couple of pizzas with this amount. Young adults in college end up saving this much after spending their pocket money.</p>\\n\\n<p>One would be tempted to feel it is an insignificant amount to begin one’s investing journey. But what if as a 20-year-old, you started investing Rs 500 per month?</p>\\n\\n<p>Assuming a modest CAGR of 12% over 25 years, you would have created a corpus of close to Rs 9.5 lakhs when you are 40. If you share this insight with any 45-year-old today, they would wish they had learnt about it two decades back as Rs 9.5 lakhs is still a significant amount.Therefore, it is important to learn early as to Why should you invest in mutual funds?</p>\\n\\n<h2>Take advantage of market's volatility</h2>\\n\\n<p>Volatility is the stock market’s ultimate truth. Before understanding how Mutual Funds take advantage of market volatility, let us understand the concept of market volatility. Volatility is the quantum of change a security’s price goes through during a given period of time. The change would be positive or negative depending on whether markets go up or down respectively.</p>\\n\\n<p>When share prices fall, the mutual fund will purchase more units of shares. Individual investors keep waiting for the bottom and sometimes miss out on purchasing shares at mouth watering prices. However, through a regular SIP, investing regularly in mutual funds helps investors take advantage of rupee cost averaging – which means cost of purchasing units averages out over a longer period of time and reduces impact of short-term volatility on one’s investment. In simpler words, volatility ensures that there are opportunities for the mutual fund portfolio manager to buy units at cheaper prices which bumps up the return on investment over a longer period of time.</p>\\n\\n<p>Warren Buffet often quotes that over the long term, there's only one direction the market will go. BSE Sensex has given a compounded annual growth rate of 16% since 1979 till December 2017. Not to forget the biggest crashes like Harshad Mehta scandal in 1992 and the global financial crisis in 2008. The bottom-line is that even the worst crashes are rather resilient to long-term returns. A correction or a crash may not necessarily be a negative thing for a long term investor.</p>\\n\\n<p>Prudent investors would avoid herd mentality. A common reason why investors are unhappy is when they see the stock market rising, they see many people booking profits. They also get greedy and cash in. Similarly, when there is crash, the same investors believe that it is a wise decision to sell and cut losses. Thus investors buy high and sell low, which negates the primary goal of investing. Hence, the most important quality for a long term investor is temperament and not intellect. This highlights another bottom-line - Don't panic, stay invested.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Why should you invest in mutual funds? It helps inculcate financial discipline.</h2>\\n\\n<p>One of the most overlooked benefits of investing is inculcating a habit of regular savings. Individuals typically believe this -&gt; Amount to invest = Income – Expenses. Whereas it should actually be -&gt; Expenses = Income – Amount Invested. Systematic Investment Plans help inculcate a ‘saving habit’ as we invest a fixed sum at regular intervals and would spend the amount that remains after that.</p>\\n\\n<p>Most investors aren’t aware that a SIP can be set up daily, monthly, quarterly or bi-annually.</p>\\n\\n<p>The earlier one begins the better as good habits take time to form!</p>\\n\\n<h2>Why should you invest in mutual funds? It helps you achieve goals</h2>\\n\\n<p>Often, individuals get enticed by ad-hoc investing. Especially in products which promise amazing returns or claim to have incomparable features. These individuals find themselves with unwanted investments which are a result of making uninformed investment decisions. And when important milestones come up, the redeemed amount turns out to be woefully short.</p>\\n\\n<p>Listing down goals and back calculating to figure out how much to invest regularly helps an individual to be financially and mentally prepared to achieve these goals when the time comes. This also reduces unnecessary stress which one may burden oneself with otherwise.</p>\\n\\n<p>Goals can be primarily divided into short-term, medium term and long term.</p>\\n\\n<p>Investments can be made in appropriate mutual funds to achieve all these different types of goals.</p>\\n\\n<p>Setting proper goals shows us the exact investment amount needed for a duration in order to reach a specific corpus. We get clarity on how much monthly investment to make and when to sell mutual funds as and when our goals near.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Why should you invest in mutual funds? It can be liquidated easily at market rate</h2>\\n\\n<p>Mutual funds are liquid since investors can redeem their funds at any given point in time. The mutual fund units are sold as per market rates on the date of selling. The money gets credited in investors’ account within 1 – 2 working days in the case of liquid or debt funds whereas amount redeemed from equity mutual funds gets credited within 4 to 5 working days. However, it is applicable only to open ended schemes, which contribute to the major share of the mutual funds in India.</p>\\n\\n<p>Close ended funds have lock-in period and the time horizon varies from funds to funds.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Why should you invest in mutual funds?It offers inflation beating returns</h2>\\n\\n<p>Let us try to understand what inflation is. Inflation is a silent thief. When the government publishes the rate of inflation @ 6%, this implies that the average cost of living for us has gone up by 6%. If we had to spend Rs. 100/- a month until last year, then we would spend Rs. 106/- a month this year. This implies keeping money stashed in lockers also looses value due to inflation as it is worth less today compared to last year when considered based on the goods or luxuries the same money can buy for us. This is typically the reason why our retirement pool more often than not seems insufficient at a later stage as people underestimate the impact of inflation.</p>\\n\\n<p>What we need is an investment that provides a return higher than inflation rate so that our savings do not lose value over time. Example: If bank FDs give us 6% rate of interest, then Rs. 100/- invested last year would be worth Rs. 106/- today. This will allow us to buy the same set of goods that we could have purchased last year for Rs. 100/-.</p>\\n\\n<p>But this is assuming there is no tax deducted at source as it would reduce our net return. Banks charge a TDS of 10% on the interest accrued if it is more than Rs 10,000 in a year.</p>\\n\\n<p>Equity mutual funds, however, do provide an opportunity to generate inflation beating returns. While the returns do tend to be volatile in the short term, over a period of time, equity mutual funds have given a return of 12% to 15% which beats inflation. Even assuming a 10% long term capital gain tax on withdrawal of income, the net return would be adequate to beat inflation and put us in a comfortable position.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Why should you invest in mutual funds?It is hassle-free to invest.</h2>\\n\\n<p><a href=\\\"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/beginners-guide-to-mutual-funds.html\\\">Investing in Mutual Funds</a> has never been easier than it is today. Creating an account happens quickly if all documents such as application form, KYC, Proof of Identity and Proof of address are submitted properly. One can easily start a SIP, modify, top up or even cancel it. Thanks to online platforms, process of investing in a mutual fund can be completed quickly. One can monitor fund performance on a daily basis thanks to the exhaustive reports offered by these platforms. Most online platforms also have an APP which can be downloaded into a mobile device and accessed to perform any operation at the investor’s convenience.</p>\\n\\n<p>Transfer of funds from bank account to the demat account offered by the platform also happens smoothly.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Variety of mutual funds to choose from according to investor profile and objective</h2>\\n\\n<p>Have you just started working? Or wish to begin investing with your pocket money? Or are you at the prime of your career? Or does retirement beckon?</p>\\n\\n<p>Do you wish to create a corpus to buy a house? Or do you want regular income? Or are you planning to save up for that solo trip?</p>\\n\\n<p>Whatever an investor’s profile or objective might be, there will be a suitable mutual fund to consider. An investor</p>\\n\\n<p><em>Mutual funds are broadly classified as Open-End Funds and Close-End Funds.</em></p>\\n\\n<p>Open ended is the type of mutual fund, that does not restrict the number of units issued by the fund. Investors can issue and redeem units continuously, since there is no limit on the issuance of number of open-end fund units.</p>\\n\\n<p>Closed-ended funds are a type of funds that are not redeemable from the fund. Unlike open-end funds, which one can redeem at any given point, investors in closed ended funds commit their funds for the duration of the fund. At the time of New Fund offering, the AMC issues a specific number of shares based on the amount of money raised. No additions can be made thereafter.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>However, a goal based classification is into Growth funds and Income funds.</em></p>\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n<h3>Growth Funds:</h3>\\n\\n<p>Growth funds usually put a huge portion in shares and growth sectors, suitable for investors who have a surplus of idle money to be distributed in riskier plans with high returns. This will also require the investment horizon to be longer as volatile markets may cause adverse movement in value of these funds and hence there may not be immediate or steady returns. Further investors looking for tax advantage may also consider investments in debt mutual funds so that they can use the indexation benefit as compared to fixed deposits.</p>\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n<h3>Income Funds:</h3>\\n\\n<p>This belongs to the family regular income plans mutual funds that distribute their money in a mix of bonds, certificate of deposits and securities among others with some allocation to equity to generate incremental returns. Spearheaded by skilled fund managers who keep manage the portfolio’s volatility and sticking to the portfolio’s objective, these Funds have earned investors better returns than deposits and are best suited for risk-averse individuals from a 1-3 years perspective.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>They can be classified further into Short term funds, Ultra short-term funds, Liquid funds. Further, as per risk appetite Equity funds can be classified into Large cap funds, Mid cap funds, Small cap funds and Sector funds.</em></p>\\n\\n<h3>Peace of mind as experts invest on your behalf</h3>\\n\\n<p>Most of us do not have the resources, time and know-how to analyse stocks and thereafter buy and sell.

We have listed them below:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>If we enter the markets when they are high, we may lose out on rupee cost averaging</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t<p>Rupee cost averaging is a way of investing, in which a fixed amount of money is invested on a fixed date, regardless of the stock value. The investors thereby end up purchasing more stocks when prices are low and fewer stocks when prices rise. In other words, we minimize the downside risk. By investing through SIP, we bear the advantages of the market volatility by investing in a phased manner. There are 248 trading days in a year. We invest in pre-committed 12 days out of 248 days by entering at different levels.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Lumpsum investing may diminish our wallet as we would invest at one go</strong>\\r\\n\\t<p>To earn Rs 50,00,000 in 10 year at a CAGR of 15%, one would have to invest a lumpsum of close to 16 lakhs. For most middle-class investors, Rs 16 lakhs is a significantly large amount. The opportunity cost of investing such a huge amount is also high and it may also put a lot of mental pressure on the investor. Investing lumpsum is tantamount to taking more risk and increasing the chances of going wrong.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>We attempt to time the market, which in reality is impossible</strong>\\r\\n\\t<p>When we decide to invest in Equity Mutual funds, we have to brace ourselves to market volatility. Delaying investments with an objective to enter at lower levels is a common approach. In such a scenario, we try to time the market. We are unlikely to succeed. For instance, if one had invested in equity mutual funds in January 2008, then till December 2011 your returns would have been in red.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t<p>Is it worth spending sleepless nights when such a scenario occurs? That is for an investor to answer. Regardless of good judgement, it is not always possible to consistently exit when markets are over bought and enter when markets are oversold.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Sometimes we receive a big bonus or a windfall gain and we end up investing the whole amount at a go.</strong>\\r\\n\\t<p>What should we do when we sell land, or receive a big bonus? Should we leave the money idle in the bank account? Or should we wait for the best entry time? Or enter the very next morning? Answer is No for all.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t<p>We definitely do not want to risk our hard earned money. In the long run, markets will appreciate but we have a much better way for riding the cycle of the market.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t<p>We can park it in Ultra short term funds and sign up for a Systematic Transfer Plan. This works similar to an SIP, where a fixed amount gets transferred from the Short term fund into our desired equity mutual fund.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Invest for the short term</strong>\\r\\n\\t<p>Before investing our lumpsums, we have to be extremely clear about our liquidity expectation. If we are going to need our money in two years for attaining a goal, we rather invest it in a short-term debt fund. Patience and calmness is the key to successful lump-sum investing.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>May not be not suitable for goal based investing</strong>\\r\\n\\t<p>Goal based investing involves achievement of a target corpus on a specific date. If we invest a large amount at one go and if markets correct, we end up jeopardising attaining the goal itself. We also do not benefit from rupee cost averaging phenomenon.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t<p>Investors who enter the tech sector and the funds linked to it in 2002, had to experience a 7-% fall in their NAVs. They had to wait for five year to see returns.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Inexperienced investors are likely to panic if market suddenly plunges</strong>\\r\\n\\t<p>Imagine a newbie investor, who hasn’t experienced market cycles, invests a large lumpsum at one go. Market volatility could result in drastic negative return with a very short period of time. This could not only cause immense stress to the new investor but also have an impact on one’s attitude towards investing.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Investing through SIP</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>SIPs offer a dream like experience in the investment journey. Some golden highlights are:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Commitment into investing, thereby inculcating discipline</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Phenomenon of Rupee cost averaging</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Helps you take advantage of market volatility</strong>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t<p>In an SIP our funds are spread over time ensuring that only some portion of our investment would have entered at peak. This makes reduce our losses and enter at a low levels in the subsequent instalment. When the markets are low, the portfolio manager can buy more number of units as compared to when the market is at its peak. This automatically reduces our per-unit cost of buying the units. This is the great rupee cost averaging phenomenon. Ultimately, we end up with higher gains.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Doesn't dent our wallet as we are investing a manageable amount regularly</strong>\\r\\n\\t<p>One can begin one’s investing journey with as less as Rs 500 per month. As one’s income increases, one can slowly start increasing one’s SIPs. Investing through SIPs doesn’t burn a hole in the investor’s wallet. The focus should be on staying invested through volatility rather than starting one’s investment journey with bigger SIPs.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>No need to time the market</strong>\\r\\n\\t<p>Market volatility is inevitable. We ought to ride the roller coaster of the market cycle. Under rupee-cost averaging, we end up buying more units when the markets are low. This not only contributes to a good discipline but also forces one to commit cash at market lows, when many other investors could be wary of entering. The&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitpl-mf-designs/hari/MFBlog/beginners-guide-to-mutual-funds.html\\\">mutual fund</a>&nbsp;is taking care of our temptation to time the market, while we can relax and watch.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Suitable for anyone who is earning regular income</strong>\\r\\n\\t<p>Salaried individuals earn a specific sum of money on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, it is human psychology to create needs once the account is flushed with funds. Then in a blink of an eye, a pre-committed amount gets debited towards an SIP. Our wonderful mind readjusts to the created needs to the new cash available in our bank account.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Investing for long term</strong>\\r\\n\\t<p>Investing through SIPs are most appropriate to achieve long term goals. These could be goals related to creating a corpus for retirement or for building a fund to ensure higher education of children. Compounding ensures that the longer one is invested, the bigger the corpus becomes. Let us consider an example –</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t<p>If one invests Rs 5000 per month for 15 years at a CAGR of 18%, the resulting corpus is Rs 46 lakhs. However, if the investor stays invested for just another 5 years – which means the number of years has now become 20, the resulting corpus becomes an eye popping Rs 1.2 crores! A gain of close to 74 lakhs in just 5 more years!</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Helps achieve goals</strong>\\r\\n\\t<p>An expert once said ‘Goal without a plan is just a wish’. SIPs throw light on how each and every goal of ours can we met. Prior to that, we need to list down our goals and set a target corpus to each of them. We then assume a reasonable rate of return and work out a monthly amount to be set aside. We are then on an auto-pilot mode to achieve our financial freedom and we stop following the herd.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>Investor can train her psyche</strong>\\r\\n\\t<p>A famous on behavioural investing goes like this – ‘An investor’s worst enemy is not the stock market but his own emotions’. For several newbie investors, it is an altogether different experience to watch their portfolio in red, especially if one has been investing in volatile mutual funds such as small cap or microcap funds regularly over 24 to 36 months. However, if one invests through SIPs in mutual funds over a longer period of time, then one can witness how volatility is actually the friend of a long-term investor. This would be because rupee-cost averaging would reduce the cost of investment and as once the market starts rising then the value of the investor’s portfolio also rises. If an investor experiences multiple bull and bear cycles, then the psyche of the investor changes and becomes much more resilient than earlier.</p>\\r\\n\\t</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>What is best SIP or Lumpsum?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Thus, various aspects of investing through SIP and investing a lumpsum amount have been made clear to the investor.

We have listed them below:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n\\t<li><strong>If we enter the markets when they are high, we may lose out on rupee cost averaging</strong>\\n\\n\\t<p>Rupee cost averaging is a way of investing, in which a fixed amount of money is invested on a fixed date, regardless of the stock value. The investors thereby end up purchasing more stocks when prices are low and fewer stocks when prices rise. In other words, we minimize the downside risk. By investing through SIP, we bear the advantages of the market volatility by investing in a phased manner. There are 248 trading days in a year. We invest in pre-committed 12 days out of 248 days by entering at different levels.</p>\\n\\t</li>\\n\\t<li><strong>Lumpsum investing may diminish our wallet as we would invest at one go</strong>\\n\\t<p>To earn Rs 50,00,000 in 10 year at a CAGR of 15%, one would have to invest a lumpsum of close to 16 lakhs. For most middle-class investors, Rs 16 lakhs is a significantly large amount. The opportunity cost of investing such a huge amount is also high and it may also put a lot of mental pressure on the investor. Investing lumpsum is tantamount to taking more risk and increasing the chances of going wrong.</p>\\n\\t</li>\\n\\t<li><strong>We attempt to time the market, which in reality is impossible</strong>\\n\\t<p>When we decide to invest in Equity Mutual funds, we have to brace ourselves to market volatility. Delaying investments with an objective to enter at lower levels is a common approach. In such a scenario, we try to time the market. We are unlikely to succeed. For instance, if one had invested in equity mutual funds in January 2008, then till December 2011 your returns would have been in red.</p>\\n\\n\\t<p>Is it worth spending sleepless nights when such a scenario occurs? That is for an investor to answer. Regardless of good judgement, it is not always possible to consistently exit when markets are over bought and enter when markets are oversold.</p>\\n\\t</li>\\n\\t<li><strong>Sometimes we receive a big bonus or a windfall gain and we end up investing the whole amount at a go.</strong>\\n\\t<p>What should we do when we sell land, or receive a big bonus? Should we leave the money idle in the bank account? Or should we wait for the best entry time? Or enter the very next morning? Answer is No for all.</p>\\n\\n\\t<p>We definitely do not want to risk our hard earned money. In the long run, markets will appreciate but we have a much better way for riding the cycle of the market.</p>\\n\\n\\t<p>We can park it in Ultra short term funds and sign up for a Systematic Transfer Plan. This works similar to an SIP, where a fixed amount gets transferred from the Short term fund into our desired equity mutual fund.</p>\\n\\t</li>\\n\\t<li><strong>Invest for the short term</strong>\\n\\t<p>Before investing our lumpsums, we have to be extremely clear about our liquidity expectation. If we are going to need our money in two years for attaining a goal, we rather invest it in a short-term debt fund. Patience and calmness is the key to successful lump-sum investing.</p>\\n\\t</li>\\n\\t<li><strong>May not be not suitable for goal based investing</strong>\\n\\t<p>Goal based investing involves achievement of a target corpus on a specific date. If we invest a large amount at one go and if markets correct, we end up jeopardising attaining the goal itself. We also do not benefit from rupee cost averaging phenomenon.</p>\\n\\n\\t<p>Investors who enter the tech sector and the funds linked to it in 2002, had to experience a 7-% fall in their NAVs. They had to wait for five year to see returns.</p>\\n\\t</li>\\n\\t<li><strong>Inexperienced investors are likely to panic if market suddenly plunges</strong>\\n\\t<p>Imagine a newbie investor, who hasn’t experienced market cycles, invests a large lumpsum at one go. Market volatility could result in drastic negative return with a very short period of time. This could not only cause immense stress to the new investor but also have an impact on one’s attitude towards investing.</p>\\n\\t</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h2>Investing through SIP</h2>\\n\\n<p>SIPs offer a dream like experience in the investment journey. Some golden highlights are:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Commitment into investing, thereby inculcating discipline</li>\\n\\t<li>Phenomenon of Rupee cost averaging</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n\\t<li><strong>Helps you take advantage of market volatility</strong>\\n\\n\\t<p>In an SIP our funds are spread over time ensuring that only some portion of our investment would have entered at peak. This makes reduce our losses and enter at a low levels in the subsequent instalment. When the markets are low, the portfolio manager can buy more number of units as compared to when the market is at its peak. This automatically reduces our per-unit cost of buying the units. This is the great rupee cost averaging phenomenon. Ultimately, we end up with higher gains.</p>\\n\\t</li>\\n\\t<li><strong>Doesn't dent our wallet as we are investing a manageable amount regularly</strong>\\n\\t<p>One can begin one’s investing journey with as less as Rs 500 per month. As one’s income increases, one can slowly start increasing one’s SIPs. Investing through SIPs doesn’t burn a hole in the investor’s wallet. The focus should be on staying invested through volatility rather than starting one’s investment journey with bigger SIPs.</p>\\n\\t</li>\\n\\t<li><strong>No need to time the market</strong>\\n\\t<p>Market volatility is inevitable. We ought to ride the roller coaster of the market cycle. Under rupee-cost averaging, we end up buying more units when the markets are low. This not only contributes to a good discipline but also forces one to commit cash at market lows, when many other investors could be wary of entering. The <a href=\\\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitpl-mf-designs/hari/MFBlog/beginners-guide-to-mutual-funds.html\\\">mutual fund</a> is taking care of our temptation to time the market, while we can relax and watch.</p>\\n\\t</li>\\n\\t<li><strong>Suitable for anyone who is earning regular income</strong>\\n\\t<p>Salaried individuals earn a specific sum of money on a monthly basis. Unfortunately, it is human psychology to create needs once the account is flushed with funds. Then in a blink of an eye, a pre-committed amount gets debited towards an SIP. Our wonderful mind readjusts to the created needs to the new cash available in our bank account.</p>\\n\\t</li>\\n\\t<li><strong>Investing for long term</strong>\\n\\t<p>Investing through SIPs are most appropriate to achieve long term goals. These could be goals related to creating a corpus for retirement or for building a fund to ensure higher education of children. Compounding ensures that the longer one is invested, the bigger the corpus becomes. Let us consider an example –</p>\\n\\n\\t<p>If one invests Rs 5000 per month for 15 years at a CAGR of 18%, the resulting corpus is Rs 46 lakhs. However, if the investor stays invested for just another 5 years – which means the number of years has now become 20, the resulting corpus becomes an eye popping Rs 1.2 crores! A gain of close to 74 lakhs in just 5 more years!</p>\\n\\t</li>\\n\\t<li><strong>Helps achieve goals</strong>\\n\\t<p>An expert once said ‘Goal without a plan is just a wish’. SIPs throw light on how each and every goal of ours can we met. Prior to that, we need to list down our goals and set a target corpus to each of them. We then assume a reasonable rate of return and work out a monthly amount to be set aside. We are then on an auto-pilot mode to achieve our financial freedom and we stop following the herd.</p>\\n\\t</li>\\n\\t<li><strong>Investor can train her psyche</strong>\\n\\t<p>A famous on behavioural investing goes like this – ‘An investor’s worst enemy is not the stock market but his own emotions’. For several newbie investors, it is an altogether different experience to watch their portfolio in red, especially if one has been investing in volatile mutual funds such as small cap or microcap funds regularly over 24 to 36 months. However, if one invests through SIPs in mutual funds over a longer period of time, then one can witness how volatility is actually the friend of a long-term investor. This would be because rupee-cost averaging would reduce the cost of investment and as once the market starts rising then the value of the investor’s portfolio also rises. If an investor experiences multiple bull and bear cycles, then the psyche of the investor changes and becomes much more resilient than earlier.</p>\\n\\t</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h2>What is best SIP or Lumpsum?</h2>\\n\\n<p>Thus, various aspects of investing through SIP and investing a lumpsum amount have been made clear to the investor. Depending on one’s financial circumstance and objectives, an investor can take a suitable call.</p>\",\r\n                \"summary\": \"\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"comment\": {\r\n                \"status\": 2,\r\n                \"cid\": 0,\r\n                \"last_comment_timestamp\": 1558428692,\r\n                \"last_comment_name\": null,\r\n                \"last_comment_uid\": 1,\r\n                \"comment_count\": 0\r\n            },\r\n            \"field_description\": \"A common predicament which an investor faces with respect to investing in mutual funds is whether to invest through SIP or whether to invest a lumpsum.\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"links\": {\r\n            \"self\": {\r\n                \"href\": \"http://192.168.93.60/drupal/jsonapi/node/article/c551b56d-64ae-4657-ada8-e6fb8895d236?resourceVersion=id%3A56\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"type\": \"node--article\",\r\n        \"id\": \"3b8e512e-ec6a-4199-865f-b2bb1ca2fdce\",\r\n        \"attributes\": {\r\n            \"status\": true,\r\n            \"title\": \"Power of SIP\",\r\n            picture: \"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/images/blog-img/mf-img-07.png\",\r\n            \"created\": \"2019-05-21T08:46:12+00:00\",\r\n            \"body\": {\r\n                \"value\": \"<h2>Introduction about SIPs</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is widely quoted that&nbsp;<strong>“Every drop in the ocean counts”</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This is especially true when it comes to investing in mutual funds.

One may feel that this is an insignificant amount. But over a period of time it makes a huge difference. Let us learn how:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Hardly pinches your pocket</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Most of us spend some money every day in buying and eating a snack worth around Rs 15 or 20. Just by saving that amount enables one to start investing in mutual funds through SIP. That's how small an amount is required to get started investing through SIP</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While we all love and deserve to spend our hard-earned money, keeping a small amount aside each month can go a long way.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>How often do we spend Rs 500 just over a whim? We may decide to order through one of the many food delivery applications or may meet up with a couple of friends at a coffee shop. Before we realize it, we end up spending around Rs 500.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Thanks to rising income and higher standard of living, it doesn’t pinch as much as it used to.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>After all, Rs 500 is what a couple of movie tickets or a couple of pizzas cost.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Most mutual funds allow investors to start investing with Rs 500 per month.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For an individual who has never invested earlier, starting off with Rs 500 per month is also a promising beginning. Therefore, this becomes a great way for new investors to begin as regularly investing Rs 500 per month over a longer period of time wouldn’t impact the investor’s wallet even if there is irregular income due to job loss or sabbaticals.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Magic of compounding</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Investors would agree that Compound interest is one of the most powerful forces in the world! This is because of the impact it has on one’s investments. Investing over a longer period of time will create substantial wealth.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Investing just Rs 500 per month can result the following scenarios</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Over 10 years, CAGR of 12% will offer Rs 1.2 lakhs</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Over 10 years, CAGR of 15% will offer Rs 1.4 lakhs</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Over 10 years, CAGR of 18% will offer Rs 1.7 lakhs</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Over 20 years, CAGR of 12% will offer Rs 5 lakhs</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Over 20 years, CAGR of 15% will offer Rs 7.6 lakhs</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Over 20 years, CAGR of 18% will offer Rs 11.7 lakhs</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Over 30 years, CAGR of 12% will offer Rs 17.6 lakhs</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Over 30 years, CAGR of 15% will offer Rs 35 lakhs</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Over 30 years, CAGR of 18% will offer Rs 71.6 lakhs</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Let us look at the illustrations which offer a CAGR of 12% across 10, 20 and 30 years. Over 10 years, the investment of Rs 500 per month turns out to be worth Rs 1.2 lakh. Over 20 years, it balloons up to Rs 5 lakhs and over 30 years it swells up to Rs 17.6 lakhs!</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>We don't lose our sleep</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Over a shorter period of time markets tend to be volatile. Even after investing consecutively for 36 months, one may see that one’s portfolio is in red. If the invested amount is small, then a new investor is able to deal with this situation and not feel stressed about it. If a new investor starts a SIP with a larger amount in a small cap fund during a choppy market, the variance in portfolio can cause the investor to chicken out and withdraw his holdings much before the magic of rupee cost averaging plays out</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As the performance of a mutual fund in which investor has started a small SIP improves, she acquires confidence to invest higher amounts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Suitable for investors who are risk averse</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are individuals who only prefer saving in fixed income or debt instruments. Due to certain reasons such investors prefer the security of lower returns rather than the opportunity presented by equity funds to beat inflation. If they haven’t tasted the growth that an equity-based instrument brings in, introducing them to the same through small SIPs is a great idea.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Some investors may not stay through the course even though the monthly invested amount is tiny. Whereas some may realize the benefits of investing in equity-based instruments as well and may seek to increase the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/iitpl-mf-designs/hari/MFBlog/SIP-or-lumpsum.html\\\">SIP</a>amount.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Continue to invest in case of unforeseen circumstances</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As the size of an investor’s portfolio increase, her confidence in the wealth creating ability of mutual funds increases. After experiencing market volatility and continuing investments regularly, the investor begins to appreciate the process of creating wealth by investing through small SIP when the mutual fund portfolio starts growing. This offers a huge boost of confidence to the investor which may result in the investor bumping up her SIPs.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Acquire confidence to invest more over a period of time as our portfolio grows</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We live in an uncertain world. Incomes have improved but job security, especially in private firms, is a big question mark. There may also be health related situations which may cause an individual to stop working for a while. We are also living in a time when individuals wish to make the most out of their lives. This includes taking a sabbatical to travel or quitting a well-paying job to start up.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>During such scenarios, one may not receive a regular flow of income. Or the size of income could reduce. Small SIPs can still be kept going as they may not cause a huge dent in an investor’s pocket during such uncertain times.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Easier to develop habit of financial discipline</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Financial discipline is rarely something we are born with. We have work on it. Let us take the example of goal-based investing. A newbie investor may start a small SIP to invest a certain amount over 5 years to achieve a goal. However, after 18 months, this individual may be tempted to buy a new laptop and would be falling short of some amount. If this individual decides to redeem the corpus which has been created so far, he may not only loss the opportunity of creating more wealth but would also fall back on his efforts to achieve his goal. Therefore it is critical to adhere to financial discipline when it comes to investing. Starting small makes it easier to get used to this. It is worth creating a habit of putting aside a small amount. Over a period of time, this would make it easier to deal with following a discipline of investing larger amounts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Claim tax benefits</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Investors who are starting out their journey in the world of investment, can look at ELSS to not only help achieve financial goals but also save tax. ELSS stands for Equity Linked Savings Schemes. ELSS is riskier than the fixed income alternatives available for tax-saving under section 80C but has the shortest lock in period among all these options. It also offers potential of growth via equity.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Especially suitable for introducing young children and young adults into the world of investing.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>According to a survey conducted by Pogo in 2016, Indian children received an average pocket money of Rs 555/- per month. Imagine as a 11-year old, one starts investing Rs 500 per month. By the time this person turns 31, she has a corpus of Rs 7.6 lakhs at a conservative CAGR of 15%. Of course, till this young investor turns 18, she can be represented by her natural or legal guardians. Anyone who disagrees can be told that Warren Buffet bought his first stock at the age of 11! Children and Young adults be introduced to investing through small amounts. We could educate them on importance of investing and saving. They can start keeping aside a small amount on a monthly or quarterly basis. If they do that for 10 years till they graduate, they can use this money for partly funding their higher studies or start ups or any other suitable opportunity.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Rome wasn’t built in a day. And neither is a huge corpus that can offer financial freedom. One can begin investing modestly and then slowly keep increasing SIPs without being influenced by noise. Once an investor signs up to ride several market cycles then there is no looking back. This is because the investor begins to understand the importance of continuously investing during good times as well as bad.

And neither is a huge corpus that can offer financial freedom. One can begin investing modestly and then slowly keep increasing SIPs without being influenced by noise. Once an investor signs up to ride several market cycles then there is no looking back. This is because the investor begins to understand the importance of continuously investing during good times as well as bad. Small SIPs are bound to do wonders to our financial health.</p>\",\r\n                \"summary\": \"\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"comment\": {\r\n                \"status\": 2,\r\n                \"cid\": 0,\r\n                \"last_comment_timestamp\": 1558428791,\r\n                \"last_comment_name\": null,\r\n                \"last_comment_uid\": 1,\r\n                \"comment_count\": 0\r\n            },\r\n            \"field_description\": \"SIP or Systematic Investment Plan is a plan through which a person can invest a small amount in a mutual fund at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly).\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"links\": {\r\n            \"self\": {\r\n                \"href\": \"http://192.168.93.60/drupal/jsonapi/node/article/3b8e512e-ec6a-4199-865f-b2bb1ca2fdce?resourceVersion=id%3A57\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"type\": \"node--article\",\r\n        \"id\": \"b02226b2-99e7-49a5-901e-ad096e0bb40a\",\r\n        \"attributes\": {\r\n            \"status\": true,\r\n            \"title\": \"Which mutual fund is most suitable for me\",\r\n            picture: \"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/images/blog-img/mf-img-08.png\",\r\n            \"created\": \"2019-05-21T08:46:12+00:00\",\r\n            \"body\": {\r\n                \"value\": \"<h2>Introduction</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It is common knowledge that unless one invests regularly it is difficult to achieve financial freedom. Thanks to mutual funds that yield best returns, one has a credible alternative to begin one’s investing journey. But figuring out which mutual fund is suitable for an investor has never been easy. Before reclassification, at last count, there were more than 2000 mutual fund schemes in India. After the reclassification mandate passed by SEBI, mutual funds will be divided into 36 categories. This requires each Asset Management Company (AMC) to divide its mutual fund offerings along these 36 categories. But for an investor, to get best returns on mutual funds, it still may be difficult to make the correct choice. In this article, we seek to assist the investor to decide which mutual fund is most suitable according to age, risk, goals, diversification and skew.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>According to Age</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There is a Thumb Rule, which says that one should invest the percentage of 100 minus our current age i.e. (100 - Age) % in aggressive funds (small cap and mid cap) and the remaining in balanced/large cap funds to get best returns.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Lumpsum investing also makes us bite the bullet by offering some hard realities.

We should decide a ratio in which we assign our capital to these asset classes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When we are in our 30s or in a preceding age range, we should pick up the most aggressive funds and watch them grow over 30 years. There is no one single size that fits everyone, but by the time we are in our 30s, we start saving money. At that time, we have 30 years for the goal like retirement. Hence we can hold on to the investment for a long period of time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When we reach say 45 years, we can switch to equity-oriented balanced funds.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When we retire, we should opt for safety of capital, which gives us our monthly return.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>However, the above can vary from person to person.

These schemes are less volatile than pure equity funds because of the mixed portfolio. The debt investments provide stability in times of volatility. These mutual funds are suitable for new stock investors and conservative equity investors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Large-cap funds invest mostly in big companies. Funds identify these companies by their market capitalisation. These companies are considered safe to invest because they are likely to be well-established players and leaders in their respective filed and can proliferate best returns. This is the reason why large-cap funds are considered suitable for conservative equity investors. These funds are likely to offer modest returns as they carry relatively less risk.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If you can deal with risk, invest higher percentage in small and mid cap or sector funds.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Midcap funds invest mostly in medium-sized companies.

Since the investments are concentrated on a single sector or theme, sector funds are considered extremely risky. It is very important to time the entry into and exit from them as the fortunes of sectors changing in different cycles in the economy. They are meant for investors with an intimate knowledge about a particular sector. Investors should take only a small exposure in them.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>According to Goals</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>For short term goals</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Planning for short term goals is different from long term goals. Objective of Short term goals is safety over growth and liquidity. Mutual funds have various categories of schemes that cater to short term investments which can help you in meeting your short term goals like planning for holidays or wedding or buying electronic gadgets or house renovation to name a few.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For very short term goals and for emergency fund you have to invest in liquid funds or ultra short term funds as emergency fund is a corpus where you would need funds immediately as and when emergency arises and hence liquidity and minimal exit load are critical drivers. These are funds that invest primarily into money market or short tenor liquid instruments but provide the flexibility to redeem the funds at short notice with minimal or no exit load.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If the goal is 3 years away, we can invest in an income fund or dynamic bond fund. These funds typically invest in corporate paper and are able to generate higher returns than bank fixed deposits in most cases.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>For medium term goals</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Some top of mind Medium term goals are saving for a down payment to buy a house or spending on one’s wedding or purchasing a car.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In order to achieve medium term goals, we can invest in balanced fund. When one opts for a balanced funds, where money is invested in debt and equity both. The debt portion works as a cushion and covers the impact if the equity portion is unable to reap great rewards. However, a combination of debt and equity largely increases the investor’s chances of reaping attractive returns with just a fair percentage of risk.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>For long term goals</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are two common and most important of long term goals: Retirement planning and Children’s Education. What kind of funds are suitable for these goals?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To start with, both retirement and children’s education, need to planned much in advance. Since the time frame for these goals is minimum 8-10 years, you can invest in equity funds. One can start by investing aggressive small cap and large cap equity funds. These funds have higher exposure to equity and hence could have volatile returns. While investing for long term we are looking for capital appreciation and hence can take risk volatility of returns on our capital. However over a longer period of time, these funds also provide higher returns.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>Large Cap Funds invest in large-cap companies. The stock prices of these companies are considerably stable compared to overall market.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Small-Cap Fund is extremely vulnerable to market ups and downs and carry higher risk. However, the reward for choosing higher risk is the attractive returns.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As we near our goals, we should start allocating some funds out of these small cap and large cap equity funds into balanced funds to reduce volatility towards the end. A strategy that gradually grows more conservative over time requires that us regularly rebalance the portfolio and ease up on your stock weighting as you get closer to our goal.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>For Diversification</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Gold funds</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Gold shines, but investing in gold may not offer impressive returns. Should one invest in Gold funds then? Yes, for diversifying assets. We diversify into various types of mutual funds so that our assets remain secure. Similarly, we can contribute some part of our portfolio in Gold, which will remain safe and grow gradually and marginally.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Foreign funds</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Investing in international funds, also supports the same logic of diversification. Returns depends on that country’s markets and forex movement. If we have extra money, it can surely go into funds. This also increases our awareness of global markets.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>For Regular income</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>How do we sustain our standard of living after we actually retire? Regular income is of prime significance.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Mutual funds can provide regular income through 2 modes:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>1.Monthly Income plans</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tMIPs offer regular income by investing in mutual funds with a monthly divided option. Most of these funds allocate only 10-20% of their corpus into equities and the rest 80-90% in safer bonds and other debt instruments. MIPs are safe as they give investors good returns if stock markets do well, but they also protect the downside because of the limited exposure to equities. Though these are called monthly income plans, there is no guarantee of monthly income. Due to the presence of equity, returns can be volatile.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li><strong>2.Systematic Withdrawal plans</strong><br />\\r\\n\\tSWP simplifies retirement life by letting investors to withdraw from their mutual fund scheme every month on an already set date. This withdrawal can be just the capital gains or a fixed or a variable amount. The same can be made annually, semi-annually, quarterly or monthly.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Skewed Portfolio</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This goes back to our golden theory of Asset Allocation. It may sometimes happen that our portfolio may get skewed towards a certain type of fund or fund house. It is then time to re-evaluate our portfolio.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Doing this is extremely important as we run the risk of not being able to liquidate enough cash when we are nearing a goal. Or we lose out on an advantage of investing in an aggressive portfolio while age supports us. Re-balancing portfolios is one of keys to keep our financial health secure.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Every individual’s needs, amount of income, aspiration and mindset are different. One should choose a mutual fund depending on these factors and not on the basis of what one’s friends or family members are doing.</p>\\r\\n\",\r\n                \"format\": \"basic_html\",\r\n                \"processed\": \"<h2>Introduction</h2>\\n\\n<p>It is common knowledge that unless one invests regularly it is difficult to achieve financial freedom.

There are reforms across sectors that prove beneficial for the public and certainly help them in a big way by saving tax. The budget of FY 2018-2019 too incorporated new areas that help you save tax, especially if you are a Senior Citizen. Since we are nearing the time which requires our intervention on saving tax, it is apt for you to know about the newly introduced sections where you can save tax.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Tax-exempted medical premium increased from INR 30,000 to INR 50,000 u/s 80 D, Income Tax Act, 1961</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This is applicable for senior citizens of 60 years of age. Till last financial year, the premium paid up to INR 30,000 towards health insurance for a senior citizen was exempted from tax. However, for the current financial year the limit has been raised to INR 50,000. So now anyone paying the medical premium up to INR 50,000 for a senior citizen will be saving tax up to INR 15,600. Tax benefit is calculated for the highest tax slab of 30% and includes 4% health and education cess.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>NPS withdrawal made 100% tax-free</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Union Cabinet has offered complete tax exemption on 60% of the NPS corpus withdrawn on maturity making NPS even more tax friendly. National Pension System is an initiative by Govt. of India which is a tax-saving investment tool that fosters retirement planning. NPS investors can invest up to INR 1.5 lakh under Sec 80 C and additional INR 50,000 under Sec 80 CCD (1B) of Income Tax Act, 1961.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>NPS is a tax-efficient tool even during the Redemption Phase. At maturity, it is mandated to utilize the 40% of the corpus to buy an annuity that continues to give a regular income/ pension to the investors, while the remaining 60% of the corpus can be withdrawn by the investor as a lump-sum amount. Earlier only 40% of this withdrawal amount was tax-free while the remaining 20% was taxed. But now there will be a complete tax exemption on this 60% of the withdrawn corpus amount.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Sr. Citizens can claim a tax deduction of up to INR 50,000 u/s 80TTB</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A new section was introduced in the Budget 2018 that benefitted the Sr. citizens - 80TTB under the Income Tax Act 1961. They can now claim a tax deduction of up to INR 50,000 on interest earned from deposits held with a bank, a banking co-operative society or with a post office. With this benefit, INR 50,000 will get deducted from the gross annual total income before the tax is levied on it. However, not all interest income can be claimed as a deduction u/s 80TTB. Following is the list of inclusions under the 80TTB of Income Tax Act:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Fixed deposits, recurring deposits or savings accounts withheld with a bank, a banking co-operative society or with a post office.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Senior Citizen Savings Scheme accounts</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Post office time deposits</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>5-year recurring deposits</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Post Office Monthly Income Schemes</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Senior citizens need not to pay TDS on interest income up to INR 50,000</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As per the clarification issued by The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) it has been stated that banks cannot deduct any TDS from a senior citizen’s interest income in a single financial year up to INR 50,000.

The budget of FY 2018-2019 too incorporated new areas that help you save tax, especially if you are a Senior Citizen. Since we are nearing the time which requires our intervention on saving tax, it is apt for you to know about the newly introduced sections where you can save tax.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Tax-exempted medical premium increased from INR 30,000 to INR 50,000 u/s 80 D, Income Tax Act, 1961</h2>\\n\\n<p>This is applicable for senior citizens of 60 years of age. Till last financial year, the premium paid up to INR 30,000 towards health insurance for a senior citizen was exempted from tax. However, for the current financial year the limit has been raised to INR 50,000. So now anyone paying the medical premium up to INR 50,000 for a senior citizen will be saving tax up to INR 15,600. Tax benefit is calculated for the highest tax slab of 30% and includes 4% health and education cess.</p>\\n\\n<h2>NPS withdrawal made 100% tax-free</h2>\\n\\n<p>The Union Cabinet has offered complete tax exemption on 60% of the NPS corpus withdrawn on maturity making NPS even more tax friendly. National Pension System is an initiative by Govt. of India which is a tax-saving investment tool that fosters retirement planning. NPS investors can invest up to INR 1.5 lakh under Sec 80 C and additional INR 50,000 under Sec 80 CCD (1B) of Income Tax Act, 1961.</p>\\n\\n<p>NPS is a tax-efficient tool even during the Redemption Phase. At maturity, it is mandated to utilize the 40% of the corpus to buy an annuity that continues to give a regular income/ pension to the investors, while the remaining 60% of the corpus can be withdrawn by the investor as a lump-sum amount. Earlier only 40% of this withdrawal amount was tax-free while the remaining 20% was taxed. But now there will be a complete tax exemption on this 60% of the withdrawn corpus amount.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Sr. Citizens can claim a tax deduction of up to INR 50,000 u/s 80TTB</h2>\\n\\n<p>A new section was introduced in the Budget 2018 that benefitted the Sr. citizens - 80TTB under the Income Tax Act 1961. They can now claim a tax deduction of up to INR 50,000 on interest earned from deposits held with a bank, a banking co-operative society or with a post office. With this benefit, INR 50,000 will get deducted from the gross annual total income before the tax is levied on it. However, not all interest income can be claimed as a deduction u/s 80TTB. Following is the list of inclusions under the 80TTB of Income Tax Act:</p>\\n\\n<p> </p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Fixed deposits, recurring deposits or savings accounts withheld with a bank, a banking co-operative society or with a post office.</li>\\n\\t<li>Senior Citizen Savings Scheme accounts</li>\\n\\t<li>Post office time deposits</li>\\n\\t<li>5-year recurring deposits</li>\\n\\t<li>Post Office Monthly Income Schemes</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>Senior citizens need not to pay TDS on interest income up to INR 50,000</h2>\\n\\n<p>As per the clarification issued by The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) it has been stated that banks cannot deduct any TDS from a senior citizen’s interest income in a single financial year up to INR 50,000. Previously the limit of TDS deduction was INR 10,000 per financial year irrespective of the age of the individual taxpayer.</p>\",\r\n                \"summary\": \"\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"comment\": {\r\n                \"status\": 2,\r\n                \"cid\": 0,\r\n                \"last_comment_timestamp\": 1558428929,\r\n                \"last_comment_name\": null,\r\n                \"last_comment_uid\": 1,\r\n                \"comment_count\": 0\r\n            },\r\n            \"field_description\": \"How Senior Citizens can get the most out of FY 2018-19 Budget to meet your tax saving goals  As any financial year begins, we come across a lot of speculations around the budget presented for that year.\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"links\": {\r\n            \"self\": {\r\n                \"href\": \"http://192.168.93.60/drupal/jsonapi/node/article/52cf1682-421a-46c9-87ee-a4b5ad84e7d7?resourceVersion=id%3A59\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        \"type\": \"node--article\",\r\n        \"id\": \"db019665-a0bd-4e2d-8b9a-c9f5108ae5ce\",\r\n        \"attributes\": {\r\n            \"status\": true,\r\n            \"title\": \"4 Myths of Mutual Funds Busted\",\r\n            picture: \"https://onebajaj.capital/resources/images/blog-img/mf-img-10.png\",\r\n            \"created\": \"2019-05-21T08:46:12+00:00\",\r\n            \"body\": {\r\n                \"value\": \"<p>Usually, Mutual Fund is considered to have risks involved in investing.

To embark on a journey to financial freedom, one must invest wisely in different types of mutual funds to maintain a diversified portfolio for better returns. Now, there are different types of mutual funds to invest in which can be classified on the basis of risk appetite and goals, whether short term or long term.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>How does one decide which type of mutual fund to invest in?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One can choose a mutual fund scheme based on one’s investment duration, objective and risk appetite.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Based on maturity or investment duration!</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Depending on its maturity period, a mutual fund scheme can be classified into open-ended scheme or close-ended scheme.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Open-ended Fund/ Scheme</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As the name suggest, an open-ended fund or scheme is one that is available for subscription and sale on a continuous basis. These schemes do not have a fixed maturity period. Investors can conveniently buy and sell units at Net Asset Value (NAV) which are declared on a daily basis. The key feature of open-end schemes is liquidity.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Close-ended Fund/ Scheme</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A close-ended fund or scheme has a maturity period that is clearly specified. When the scheme is launched, the fund is open for subscription only during a prescribed period. Thereafter investors can buy or sell the units of the scheme on the stock exchanges as they would do in case of any other listed security. To enable investors to exit, some close-ended funds offer an option of selling back the units to the mutual fund through periodic repurchase at NAV related prices.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Based on objective Receiving Creating a corpus or Regular Income – Growth or Dividend</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One’s investment objective may also determine the type of fund which one would have to shortlist:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Growth Funds</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Growth funds usually put a huge portion in shares and growth sectors, suitable for investors who have a surplus of idle money to be distributed in riskier plans (albeit with possibly high returns) and can wait over a period of time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This will also require the investment horizon to be longer as volatile markets may cause adverse movement in value of these funds and hence there may not be immediate or steady returns.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Dividend Funds</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For investors who seek to earn a regular income, dividend funds are best suited. However, there is a difference in the dividends that are offered by stocks and by mutual funds. In the case of stocks, dividends are earnings generated by a company (usually profits) that are distributed amongst shareholders. This is besides the appreciation in share price of a stock. Whereas in the case of a dividend mutual fund, a small chunk of the units or shares of the mutual fund are sold at a price which is higher than the purchase price to earn dividends. The dividend pay-outs can be monthly, quarterly or yearly. Depending on the fund, the dividend can also be re-invested.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Based on Risk Appetite</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Risk appetite is also a function of investment goals. A retired citizen who is investing for regular monthly income would have a different risk appetite from someone who is investing with horizon of a decade for buying a house.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Index funds mirror an index.</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>These funds will purchase stocks in the same proportion in which they comprise an index. For instance, if a particular stock forms 2% of an index which is being followed by a mutual fund, the mutual fund will invest 2% of its investible corpus in that particular stock. The performance of an index fund will more or less mimic that of the index which it follows except for a difference that would creep up, known as tracking error. Expenses incurred by an index fund are lower as compared to other types of mutual funds.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Balanced funds are also known as hybrid funds. These are primarily of two types: Equity Oriented Funds and Debt Oriented Funds.</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Equity-oriented funds</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Equity-oriented funds invest a mix of equity (at least 65 per cent of the corpus) and debt. These funds offer attractive returns over a longer period of time but returns can be highly volatile in the short term. These funds are suitable for investors who can deal with the risk and have a longer investment horizon.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Debt-oriented funds</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Debt-oriented funds are low risk funds that primarily invest in highly rated corporate bonds and stable government bonds. They offer steady returns and are suitable for conservative investors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Equity Linked Savings Schemes</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Equity Linked Savings Schemes make it possible for investors to claim uptoRs 1.5 lakhs as tax deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act while creating a corpus! However, an investor cannot withdraw money before 3 years as this scheme has a mandatory lock in period.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Largecap Funds</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Largecap funds invest mostly in big companies. Funds identify these companies by their market capitalisation. These companies are well established and have immense credibility. They are most likely to be among the top names in their respective sector. Although there is no fixed nomenclature, a company whose market cap is more than Rs 10,000 crores is considered to be a large cap company in India. Conservative and risk averse investors can start investing in large cap funds.

To embark on a journey to financial freedom, one must invest wisely in different types of mutual funds to maintain a diversified portfolio for better returns. Now, there are different types of mutual funds to invest in which can be classified on the basis of risk appetite and goals, whether short term or long term.</p>\\n\\n<h2>How does one decide which type of mutual fund to invest in?</h2>\\n\\n<p>One can choose a mutual fund scheme based on one’s investment duration, objective and risk appetite.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Based on maturity or investment duration!</h2>\\n\\n<p>Depending on its maturity period, a mutual fund scheme can be classified into open-ended scheme or close-ended scheme.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Open-ended Fund/ Scheme</h3>\\n\\n<p>As the name suggest, an open-ended fund or scheme is one that is available for subscription and sale on a continuous basis. These schemes do not have a fixed maturity period. Investors can conveniently buy and sell units at Net Asset Value (NAV) which are declared on a daily basis. The key feature of open-end schemes is liquidity.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Close-ended Fund/ Scheme</h3>\\n\\n<p>A close-ended fund or scheme has a maturity period that is clearly specified. When the scheme is launched, the fund is open for subscription only during a prescribed period. Thereafter investors can buy or sell the units of the scheme on the stock exchanges as they would do in case of any other listed security. To enable investors to exit, some close-ended funds offer an option of selling back the units to the mutual fund through periodic repurchase at NAV related prices.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Based on objective Receiving Creating a corpus or Regular Income – Growth or Dividend</h2>\\n\\n<p>One’s investment objective may also determine the type of fund which one would have to shortlist:</p>\\n\\n<h3>Growth Funds</h3>\\n\\n<p>Growth funds usually put a huge portion in shares and growth sectors, suitable for investors who have a surplus of idle money to be distributed in riskier plans (albeit with possibly high returns) and can wait over a period of time.</p>\\n\\n<p>This will also require the investment horizon to be longer as volatile markets may cause adverse movement in value of these funds and hence there may not be immediate or steady returns.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Dividend Funds</h3>\\n\\n<p>For investors who seek to earn a regular income, dividend funds are best suited. However, there is a difference in the dividends that are offered by stocks and by mutual funds. In the case of stocks, dividends are earnings generated by a company (usually profits) that are distributed amongst shareholders. This is besides the appreciation in share price of a stock. Whereas in the case of a dividend mutual fund, a small chunk of the units or shares of the mutual fund are sold at a price which is higher than the purchase price to earn dividends. The dividend pay-outs can be monthly, quarterly or yearly. Depending on the fund, the dividend can also be re-invested.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Based on Risk Appetite</h2>\\n\\n<p>Risk appetite is also a function of investment goals. A retired citizen who is investing for regular monthly income would have a different risk appetite from someone who is investing with horizon of a decade for buying a house.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Index funds mirror an index.</h3>\\n\\n<p>These funds will purchase stocks in the same proportion in which they comprise an index. For instance, if a particular stock forms 2% of an index which is being followed by a mutual fund, the mutual fund will invest 2% of its investible corpus in that particular stock. The performance of an index fund will more or less mimic that of the index which it follows except for a difference that would creep up, known as tracking error. Expenses incurred by an index fund are lower as compared to other types of mutual funds.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Balanced funds are also known as hybrid funds. These are primarily of two types: Equity Oriented Funds and Debt Oriented Funds.</strong></p>\\n\\n<h3>Equity-oriented funds</h3>\\n\\n<p>Equity-oriented funds invest a mix of equity (at least 65 per cent of the corpus) and debt. These funds offer attractive returns over a longer period of time but returns can be highly volatile in the short term. These funds are suitable for investors who can deal with the risk and have a longer investment horizon.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Debt-oriented funds</h3>\\n\\n<p>Debt-oriented funds are low risk funds that primarily invest in highly rated corporate bonds and stable government bonds. They offer steady returns and are suitable for conservative investors.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Equity Linked Savings Schemes</h3>\\n\\n<p>Equity Linked Savings Schemes make it possible for investors to claim uptoRs 1.5 lakhs as tax deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act while creating a corpus! However, an investor cannot withdraw money before 3 years as this scheme has a mandatory lock in period.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Largecap Funds</h3>\\n\\n<p>Largecap funds invest mostly in big companies. Funds identify these companies by their market capitalisation. These companies are well established and have immense credibility. They are most likely to be among the top names in their respective sector. Although there is no fixed nomenclature, a company whose market cap is more than Rs 10,000 crores is considered to be a large cap company in India. Conservative and risk averse investors can start investing in large cap funds. These funds carry less risk and offer modest returns.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Midcap funds</h3>\\n\\n<p>Midcap funds invest mostly in medium-sized companies. Their rise and fall, both could occur at a scorching space. But these companies may successfully grow over a period of time and provide handsome returns to investors. Investors with the ability to take considerable risks should bet on these funds.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Smallcap funds</h3>\\n\\n<p>Smallcap funds invest in small companies. Investing in these companies over short term could be perilous unless backed by substantial research and credible experience. However, they can also offer phenomenal return over a longer duration of time. They are appropriate only for investors with a significantly high-risk appetite.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Sector funds</h3>\\n\\n<p>Sector funds invest only in businesses which are operating in a particular sector. For example, a Pharma themed fund will only invest in Pharmaceutical companies. As investments are directed towards a specific sector or theme, sector funds are considered extremely risky. Timing the entry into and exit from these sectoral funds is imperative as some of these sectors are cyclical. They are meant for investors with deep knowledge about a specific sector.
